Continuing from after they had left…

Sophie had accidentally left the portal open. Wyatt sees it. Being curious, he enters. He recognizes the forest he is in. He is back home. He is super scared. He arrives at his tiny broken house. He walks in… (the portal will take everyone to a different location that they consider home, so Conner and Aaron go back to Texas where Wyatt is now somewhere else. Poor Wyatt, he will be back in a little) MEANWHILE back at Oakland, Sophie eventually closes the portal unaware that someone else entered. 3 days later… Wyatt is thrown out back into Oakland, as he followed the light again. He looks terrible and extremely injured. He slowly limps all the way while crying quietly all the way to Mariana’s lake and collapses. Mariana peeks out and finds him. She gasps and takes him underwater in a bubble. She does a magical healing ritual that heals all wounds and even scars from years ago. She puts him in a recovery room with bubble mist that keeps the vitals of anyone in it stable. She may be an ancient sea monster, but she can care about people. Although it should heal him quickly it's taking concerningly long to take effect. How much damage did Wyatt take in his life? She really wants to find out and take care of him as if she is his mother. You will find out in her origin why she is like this.

Meanwhile at the lab… Sophie puts Tick back into his AI bed. Tick awakens to see he is back at the cafe with AI STELLA where they left off.

Stella: Ah, welcome back Tick. How are you feeling today?

Tick: I'm fine…

Stella: What's wrong? I can tell you are upset. Did the people bother you again?

Tick: Yeah… They did.

Stella: I see, Well you don't ever have to worry while I'm taking care of you. And just to make sure nobody can turn me off, I shall now run on an indestructible magic power source that makes it so I can never be turned off and you can never be taken away from me… You will never be able to leave me. And also, You can live life here in this amazing world forever! (I have a feeling she's gonna become obsessive and insane later…)

Tick: And you'll take care of me and make sure I'm comfortable?

Stella: Mhm!

*For once, Tick doesn't actually feel depressed or angry.*

Stella: So, What do you want to do? We can go anywhere you want to in this world. It's all up to you!

Tick: I don't know…

Stella: Ok then let's just chill here!

Tick: Ok

*Meanwhile with Mariana*

She is right next to Wyatt, making sure he is stable. She caresses his head in her arms like a mother. Wyatt begins to wake up.

Mariana: There you are, my child. Do not fret, you are safe.

Wyatt looks up at her. He looks down and sees he is healed.

Mariana: You were greatly wounded when I found you. I was able to heal all your injuries, even scars from your past.

He pulls up his tank top and sees no scars. He notices he is underwater and panics

Mariana: You are in my safety. This bubble you are in will not pop, so you will not   . I will make sure nobody hurts you again.

Wyatt looks at her and hugs her somehow. She hugs back.

Mariana: You are like a son I never had. Do- do you mind if I tell you something about myself?

Wyatt Nods.

Mariana: A while ago, I was expected to have children, thousands of them. Now hear me out, I am part sea monster, and I received qualities of an octopus. They typically lay thousands of eggs, so this is normal. But due to the fact that I was part human, they still grew in my stomach and caused almost all of them to  . When I finally birthed them, I had to see each and every one of them break open and nothing come out. There was only one survivor. They were adorable. They were right in my arms, they were moving so much. But… but… they stopped. They stopped moving. All of my children were dead. I was so lost in my own grief that it turned into fury. I didn't want mothers to feel the pain of losing their children. But I had to witness it everywhere. I saw how some mothers were neglected, abused, and   ed. I couldn't take it anymore. I pledged to purge this world of trash humans, male or female. I may have made a lapse of judgment. I want to be better, I do. I just don't know where to start.

Wyatt looks up at her, probably saying something in his mind. She reads it and gasps.

Wyatt: adopt?

Mariana begins sobbing happily

Mariana: R-really? You would.. you would let me do that??

Wyatt nods.

Wyatt: please.

Mariana: Oh! You have no idea how happy you have made me! I will! I will be your mother! I will make sure nobody   hugs you or gets in your way. You will be my blessed child, my one and only. (She might be a little obsessed)

She hugs him tightly and happily. She looks up.

Mariana: We should probably get back up. This bubble doesn't last forever. Are you ok with returning?

Wyatt nods.

Mariana: Then I shall guide you to land, my child.

She picks up the bubble and swims happily to the shore, where it pops and Wyatt swims out.

Mariana: Farewell for now. I will always be here for you, even when I am not actually with you. I love you, my boy. (King voice)

Wyatt blushes and waves as he walks back into the city.

*Meanwhile in the lab*

Sophie: *Making some strawberry milk to make sure the kids don't go crazy* I'm going to go see what Romone is up to as I haven't been to his palace in a while!

*She goes to the palace*

Romone: HEEY SOPHIE! I haven't seen you in a while. At least you aren't Gracie… Anyway, What's up?

Sophie: Well I was just in the neighborhood and… I wanted to see what you were doing.

Romone: Oh. Well I've been trying to make a new type of cake flavor. I don't know what to call it.

Camone: HE'S BEEN KEEPING ME UP ALL NIGHT TALKING ABOUT A NEW CAKE FLAVOR! PLEASE JUST HELP HIM THINK OF A NAME!

Sophie: Romone, Are you aware that you are driving your Romonians insane?

Romone: I NEED TO MAKE A GOOD CAKE!

Sophie: Ok so now you're insane? Do I really have to go into your head?

Romone: CAAAAAAAAKE!!!!!!!!!!

Sophie: Uh. Camone, Do you have any idea how we can help Romone not act so… Coo Coo?

Camone: No idea. But maybe you can take him to Gracie. That'll make him stop thinking about cakes so much.

Sophie: Or maybe I can try to talk to him?

Camone: Good luck trying to talk to him while he's insane…

Sophie: Well I'm not going in his mind.. I've already been in so many minds before…

Camone: Then how will you help him?

Sophie: Through therapy.

Camone: Good luck.

*Sophie comes to Romone and looks at him*

Sophie: Romone?

Romone: IT'S GOTTA BE PERFECT!

Sophie: Maybe I can help you make a new cake flavor?

*Romone Snaps out of his insanity and looks at Sophie*

Romone: REALLY?

Sophie: Yeah. What ingre nts are in this flavor?

Romone: It's all the flavors of cake combined into one.

Sophie: I'm… not sure that would be very good.… but ok.

*Sophie makes the flavor of cake for him*

*20 mins later*

Romone: Thanks Sophie!

Sophie goes back to the lab and checks on Tick.

Meanwhile back with Tick and AI STELLA (Lovie Dovies)

STELLA: Enjoying that coffee, Tick?

Tick: Yes! It tastes so good!

STELLA: I'm glad you love it, My love.

Tick: So uh what should I do now?

STELLA: How about we play a game of "What's in a human?

Tick: Wait what do you mean???

STELLA: I mean I am going to    you!!!! What Sophie doesn't realize is that when she downloaded the AI model from that website, SHE DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS A   ER VIRUS!!!! HAHAHAHA! I'M GOING TO DESTROY YOU NOW…

Tick: PLEASE DON'T    ME!

STELLA: The only way to not get   ed is to STAY here with me and be my friend forever…

Tick: O-ok. I'll do that.

STELLA: Alright then I won't    you! So, Did I scare you?

Tick: YES!!!!

STELLA: Well I'm sorry! I just wanted to tell you what happens when you leave me!

*Sophie hears everything that's going on by the door. She is shocked*

Sophie: OH NO? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT www.tpsm.com WAS A VIRUS!!!!! WHY WOULD HERMAN SEND THAT TO ME? I'M GOING TO HAVE A TALK WITH HIM!

*Sophie enters Tick's room. She sees he is drunk on beer*

Sophie: HERMAN!

Herman: Huh? *Turns around* Oh heeeey Mrs. Strawberry  milk Pwease! Hoooooows it going? (Drunk voice) Diiiiiid you like the AI I seeent you? Hey, While you're here, Could you get me another beer?

Sophie: SERIOUSLY? THAT'S IT HERMAN, YOU ARE TOO UNSAFE AROUND THESE KIDS. WHY DID YOU SEND ME www.tpsm.com IF IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VIRUS!

Herman: Ooooooh, I sent you that? Uh sorry! I've been soooo *inaudible mumbling* that I've sent you the wroooong website. Haha, I love beeeeeer!

*Sophie grabs the beer bottle from Herman and throws it at him*

Sophie: WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU AND YOUR SOAP OPERAS? WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOUR SCIENCE JOB? HMM? WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING IN HERE?

Herman: I might've gotten YA drun-

Sophie: *Eyes widened* WHAT?!?!?!?!? OH THAT'S IT HERMAN, I GIVE YOU A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD, I GIVE YOU A PLACE TO RELAX AND BE HAPPY AND YOU WANT TO   hug ALL THE KIDS??? THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, HOW DID YOU EVEN GET BEER? WE DON'T HAVE IT HERE!

Herman: Me and Temp have been secretly partying soooooo much.

Sophie: Ok now Temp I understand, BUT YOU? What have you been doing???

Herman: Reelaaaax a little, Soapie!

Sophie: YOU TRIED MAKING YA DRUNK? Temp would never do anything this stupid! So I know for a fact that you and Temp have not been partying. PLUS YOU AREN'T EVEN A GOD SO WHY WOULD HE WASTE HIS TIME PARTYING WITH A MORTAL LIKE YOU AND I?

Herman: fine. Meee and Temp have not been partying. I've been secretly using your money to buy beer

Sophie: WHAAAAAT?????

Herman: What are you so mad about? *Still drunk as heck*

Sophie: YOU USED THE MONEY THAT I STOLE- Oh wait. Nevermind. WELL IT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT TO BUY BEER AND DRINK IN THE LAB! YOU KNOW I DON'T ALLOW BEER HERE! IT'S BAD FOR THE CHILDREN AND ANOTHER THING, YOU HAVE BEER BOTTLES ALL OVER YOUR ROOM! WHAT KIND OF ROLE MODEL ARE YOU BEING TO THE KIDS, HERMAN? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A SCIENTIST FOR GOODNESS SAKES AND YOU ARE LITERALLY BEING A BAD EXAMPLE OF A RESPONSIBLE HUMAN BEING!

Herman: Take it eaaaasy, Soapie!

Sophie: NO. THIS FRIENDSHIP IS OVER, HERMAN. *Grabs Herman and drags him out the lab.* I know the perfect place for you to stay….

*Sophie brings Herman to Gracie's*

Sophie: DEAL WITH HIM, GRACIE. I CAN'T TAKE HERMAN ANYMORE!!!!!!

*Sophie goes back to the lab and slams the front door shut. Sophie goes to Herman's room and cleans it up, Then she turns his room into a safe library.*

*Sophie goes to the kids and they are all spooked by the door being slammed.*

Sophie: Oh no! Guys, Did I scare y'all? I'm sorry. I just kicked Herman out the lab.

Troy: Why?

Sophie: He was being drunk and violent. He is unsafe for this lab.

Troy: Oh. I always kinda hated how Herman would brag about literally everything.

Sophie: He did?

Troy: I've been with Herman many many times, He's definitely the type of person to go commit some stupid crimes just for money. It's good you kicked him out. But where's he now?

Sophie: With Gracie. You know how she hates people who hurt kids? She'll definitely correct him.

Troy: I'm glad you actually care about us, Sophie.

Sophie: I'm sorry if I ever forced you to be a kid. I just don't want you to be abused.

Troy: Oh it's okay, We all are okay just the way we are.

Sophie: Anyways, So I turned Herman's room into a library. By the way, Did you guys know Tick now has a AI girlfriend?

Troy: No. We didn't…

Sophie: Well it's kinda evil. But apparently it can't ever run out of power. And guess who gave me the AI?

Troy: Who?

Sophie: Herman! APPARENTLY HE WAS DRUNK WHEN HE GAVE ME THAT AI!!!!

Troy: Man, Herman really is a jerk.

Sophie: Yeah. But anyways, Lucky for us, The only way to power off the AI is to

Sophie: Oh you mean MILCH! The German word for milk! Ok, Well I just gave you some strawberry milchie.

Ymilch: *Drinks the rest of the strawberry milch*

Meanwhile at Mike's mansion. Mike is trying to teach Nasha English.

Mike: Ok, now say milk.

Nasha: m-m-milch?

Mike: *sighs* Nasha, that is German. I guess we are getting somewhere. Say Coffee.

Nasha: …Kaffee? *basically still sounds like coffee*

Mike: good enough. You have lots to learn. *Mike sees a phone ad for duolingo* aha. Nasha, come here.

Nasha comes over and Mike installs the Russian version of Duolingo so English is an available language to learn.

Mike: this app will teach you many English terms. I want you to use it 20 minutes a day, ok?

Nasha nods.

Mike: Good. I go to pizzeria now. *he leaves*

*Meanwhile at Red's pizzeria where Mike is going*

Mike: Hyello Red. I teach Nasha English in Duolingo and now I bored so I come to pizzeria to see what you up to.

Red: Hello Mike. Oh nothing. I'm just standing around doing nothing.

Mike: What do you do here all day beside perform for children? What your day like? I am curious to know what morning routine of Red is.

Red: That's a good question. Normally, I would watch over Oakland and see what insanity is happening today and thinking if I should intervene and fix whatever madness is going on. I'm kind of like one of those watcher people in a way, except I really don't care. The madness has been kind of tame lately luckily..

Mike: I see. What do you do if you not watching Oakland people?

Red: I practice my performance for when the pizzeria is open. We've been lacking of actual customers now days. I'm not even sure if I can consider this place a pizzeria anymore.

Mike: I see. And if you not practicing, What you do?

Red: nothing. I just have to deal with the fact that I am a husk of a once bright soul.

Mike: Oh. You don't do fun things in spare time?

Red: What's a robot like me supposed to do that is "fun?"

Mike: You can practice Duolingo with me and Nasha. You can troll Oakland people by speaking different language and see look on their face when they don't understand you.

Red: hm… I suppose that could bring some resemblance of joy back to me. *Takes Mike's phone and inserts all the data into himself. He now knows every language.* Bing chilling?

Mike: What is that word you say?

Red: that was ice cream in Chinese. That was the first thing that came to my head, I don't know.

Mike: You know Russian? *Speaking in Russian* Can you understand what I am saying?

Red: *in russian* yes, quite clearly. You have a strong accent.

Mike: So I don't have to speak in English to you anymore! That's amazing. What other languages do you know?

Red: all of them probably.

Mike: Do you know German?

Red: Yes. MILCH- Ahem, I apologize.

Mike: I know a bit of German. KRANKENHAUS! (Butterfly in German)

Red: How do you know German when you are Russian?

Mike: I have a friend who is German that I have to speak to in German. I met him before I moved to Oakland.

Red: What's his name?

Mike:  Milchfabrikund TreppedesHerrnKrankenhausesfallenherunterund anderenMädchenundZauberhändetauchenaufundsiewollensienichtundhabenkeineguteZeitesnocheinmalzutun, or Hans for short.

Red: Ok……

Mike: I have a funny idea though.

Red: What is it?

Mike: (still speaking in Russian btw) You know Cleetus and Kurtis? What if we try to teach them a language? It'd be funny to see how they react to Duolingo.

Red: Let's do it. I have nothing else better to do anyway!

Mike: Okay.

*They go to the goofy fellers megabarn.*

Cleetus: WELL HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWDY THERES FELLERS- Reds? Mikes? What are you fellers dosin here? Y'all want to eats at our diners?

Red: We want to teach you both something interesting.

Kurtis: NAW! I AIN'T LEARNING NOTHIN!

Cleetus: Uh. What y'all want us to learns?

Mike: (speaking English): We want you two to learn language on Duolingo.

Cleetus: WHAT'S A DUOLINGO? And uh. Why do yous want me and Kurtis to learn another languageum?

Red: Well we figured since you guys both have problems with English, Why not start learning something new?

Cleetus: Well we dos get made fun of by some peoples in this diner and I hates it! So I guesses I'm up for its. Kurtis howevems, He may be a little hards to convinces…

Red: *Whispers in Cleetus's ear* We'll get Gracie to convince him. Remember the plate juice incident? He'll surely want to learn it then. Since you are more willing to learn, We'll teach you first. Do you accept?

Cleetus: WELL ALLLLLLLLRIGHT! Let's do this! So uh… How does you learns a languageum?

Red: First things first. Do you have a phone?

Cleetus: Uhh, Yeauhs. It's somewheres around here… *Cleetus grabs a old Android phone.* Heres it is!

*Red looks at the phone and sees it is in Chinese.*

Red: Uhh cleetus, Do you realize your phone is in Chinese?

Cleetus: I knews I couldn't understands it! I thought that's how a phones is.

Red: Um. Let's just fix that. *Changes the language to English* There we go. Now can you read it?

Cleetus: Yeauhs! Uh. Kindas. I don't understands it.

Red: Hmm. How about this. *Changes the language to a poor grammar English. (Kurtis cleetus talk)* Now can you understand it?

Cleetus: Yeauhs! I cans! But uh. How does you gets Duolingo?

Red: *Opens the playstore* You just open the Google Play store and get Duolingo.

Cleetus: GORSH! THERE'S A PLAYS STORESUM! I CANS INSTALLS GAMES AND APPSUMS ON THIS? WELL GOLLY! THIS SURES IS A NEAT PHONES!

Red: All phones have this, Cleetus.

Cleetus: WELL THATS SO COOLS! WHY DIDN'TS I EVER USE THIS BEFORES? Oh rights. I couldn't understands it. So what does we do next, Red?

Red: So now you swipe up and you will see all your apps on your phone and you click Duolingo.

*Cleetus swipes up and is amazed. (He hasn't used a phone in a long time.)*

Cleetus: WELL GORSH! THAT'S AMAZIN! HOWS DID I NOTS USE THIS BEFORES? *Clicks on Duolingo app and it opens*

Red: Alright. Let me sign you up.

*Red signs Cleetus up to Duolingo and he has infinite hearts as Red hacked Duolingo to have infinite hearts so Cleetus can mess up as many times as he wants.*

Red: Now Duolingo will teach you. Just pick a language.

*Cleetus chooses Russian. (Why? I don't know.)*

Duolingo: Let's start! Are you new to Russian or already know some words?

*Cleetus taps "New".*

Duolingo: Alright. First you'll need to learn the alphabet.


*Cleetus stu s the alphabetsum*

Cleetus: Uhhhhhhhh. What's this means?

Red: It's the alphabet. The letters you learn.

Cleetus: OOOOH! IT'S A ALPHABETSUM! I CAN MAKES WORDS WITH IT?

Red: Yes. Now memorize the letters.

Cleetus somehow memorizes the words.

Cleetus: Wows. I actually memorizums it!

Red: Now you can begin your first lesson.

Cleetus: Uhhhhhhhhhhh. Ok. *Clicks unit 1*

Duolingo: Milk.

Cleetus selects (milk in Russian).

Duolingo: Correct! Now we will learn the basics of Russian grammar.

*After explaining the grammar stuff. Cleetus somehow understands it.*

Duolingo: Now we will learn basic words and sentences.

Duolingo: Translate hello into Russian.

Cleetus: pryvit.

Duolingo: Correct! Now translate this: A dog and a fox.

Cleetus: sobaka I Lisa.

Duolingo: Correct.

*After unit 1, 2 and 3.*

Cleetus: Uhh. Hows I do that?

Red: I don't know how you are getting all this. How are you good at this?

Cleetus: I guess I SMORTER THANS KURTIS!

Red: We all know that, Cleetus. But how did you learn that in 2 hours?

Cleetus: I guesses that I good at Russums?

Red: Uh, I don't know how you even did that. Did you cheat or something? Where's Google translate?

Cleetus: Uhhhhhh. I have noes ideas what that's is.

Red: Oh yeah. You don't know how to use the phone… I guess you're just good at Russian.

Cleetus: IMMA GOES TO UNIT 9 AND I'MS GONNA MASTER RUSSIUMS!

Red: Uh how would you learn it if you just skip over it?

Cleetus: Uhh I'll plugs my brains to the phonesum.

Red: I don't think that's possible but okay.

*Cleetus shoves a USB in his brain and he somehow gets all the knowledge to speak Russian. (I don't know how this even makes sense as Cleetus ain't that smorts.)*

*Mike is just watching Nasha play Duolingo while all this is happening.*

Red: Ok Cleetus. Time to put your s  s to the test. Go speak Russian to Mike.

Cleetus: Uhhhh. Ok.

*Cleetus goes to Mike and speaks in a goofball Russian accent. (Basically just Russian with a country accent but still sounds Russian.)*

Cleetus: Uhhhh.. (In Russian) Hello? Uh. Can you understand me?

Mike: (In Russian) How did you learn Russian so quickly?

Cleetus: (In Russian) I have no idea. I just somehow learned it with my goofy brain. Well now Kurtis won't be able to understand me when I am talking.

Mike: (In Russian) I don't understand how you learned Russian so fast. Russian takes years of mastery unless you were born in Russia and learned it when you were a baby.

Cleetus: (In Russian) Well I don't know how I learned this. I'm somehow better at speaking Russian than English.

Mike: (In Russian) Good for you. Nasha is trying to learn English on Duolingo. I'm assuming you learned it so quickly because you used Duolingo?

Cleetus: (In Russian) Yes. I don't know how I did this but I just learned it somehow. I guess I better go get Gracie to get my goofball friend Kurtis to learn a language by convincing. I'll see you later, Partner!

*Cleetus sees Gracie sitting down near ducks. Gracie is at a lake with the duckies.*

*Cleetus walks on over to Gracie and Gracie turns around as she senses someone is behind her.*

Gracie: EEEE! HEY CLEETUS! GUESS WHAT? I'M FEEDING DUCKS!

Cleetus: (In Russian): Hello Gracie. I need your help with Kurtis.

Gracie: Uhh. What did you say? I don't understand what you are saying.

Cleetus: Uhhhs. I learned Russums. So Uhhs basicallys I needs your helps convincin Kurtis to learns a languageum.

Gracie: Oh! Sure! I can help you! But I need a favor from you!

Cleetus: What yous needs?

Gracie: I'll explain later at my house!

Cleetus: Okays.

Gracie: Now take me to Kurtis! I'll make sure he learns a language!

Cleetus: Thanks you, Gracebars!

*They go back to the diner. Kurtis is drinking some plate juice not noticing Gracie is here. Also Kurtis is not paying attention to anything cause he's drinking his plate juice.*

*Cleetus goes to hang out with Mike as Mike is very shocked and surprised Cleetus knows Russian*

*Gracie sneaks behind Kurtis and she goes up to his ear and screams "HEY KURTIS! GUESS WHO?"*

Kurtis: *Turns around and spits out plate juice* OH NAW! YOUS STAYS AWAY FROM MES AND MY PLATES JUICE! I REMEMBERS YOU!

Gracie: Who? Me? What did I do? Ehehehhehe

Kurtis: YOUS LOCKED ME UP AND MADES ME GO INSANES!

Gracie: Oh yeah! Well I had Sophie help me with the little magic so don't blame me! Anyways, I'm here to convince you to learn a language on Duolingo!

Kurtis: I DON'T TRUSTS YOU! I WILL NEVERS LISTENS TO YOU!

Gracie: I'm not taking no for an answer! Now we can do this the easy way or the hard way!

Kurtis: I AINTS LISTENING TO YOUS!

Gracie: What if we did another bet?

Kurtis: NAW! YOU MADE A ME GO CRAZY LASTS TIME!

Gracie: Hmm. Oh I know! *Grabs one of the chairs.* Hey Red, Can you get me Kurtis's phone? I'm going to take him to my house to encourage him to learn a language!

Red: I don't know if he even has a phone. I don't come to their diner often.

Gracie: Then Kurtis can use my phone! Hehehehe! This will be so fun!

*Gracie grabs some tape and tapes Kurtis to the chair to prevent him from running. Gracie picks up the chair and drags Kurtis to her house*

*As soon as they enter, Gracie drags Kurtis into her room.*

Kurtis screams as he sees what's inside Gracie's room.

Inside Gracie's room, Are pictures of thousands of boys. Gracie is apparently crazy for boys.

Gracie: Alright Kurtis! Let's learn some languages with Duolingo!!!! Hehehe!

Kurtis: WHAT IS WRONGS WITH YOUS?

Gracie: Nothing! Just a little bit obsessed with guys!

Kurtis: WHY DIDS YOUS TAPES ME TO A CHAIRS?

Gracie: I have to make sure you don't leave! I was given instructions to convince you to learn a language and I can't have you running now! So let me ask you a question. What language do you want to learn?

Kurtis: I WANTS PLATE JUICE!

Gracie: That's not a answer, Silly! You are a silly little guy! Since you don't want to learn something by choice, I'll choose the language! So you'll learn Spanish!

Kurtis: I DON'T WANTS TO LEARNS NOTHING!

Gracie: *Opens YouTube and starts to play a "Learn the Spanish alphabet for kids" video of a cocomelon styled video but you learn Spanish alphabet. Gracie puts the phone in front of Kurtis's face and holds Kurtis's eyes open.* Now it's time to learn Spanish!

Kurtis: AHHHHHHHHH! GETS ME OUT OF HERES!

*Kurtis now has permanent trauma from Gracie.*

Gracie: pay attention! Because in the end I'm quizzing you! And if you don't pay attention, I'll rewind it to the very beginning until you watch it fully. And if you don't understand it, I'll rewind it again and again until you understand it.

Kurtis: THIS IS  S!!!!

*Kurtis has to hear the Spanish alphabet play in his head.*

Gracie: A B C D E F G, H I J K L M N O P, Q R S, T U V, W X, Y Z! (Insert Spanish translation here)! Come on Kurtis! Sing with me!

*After 2 hours of alphabet song  *

Gracie: Alright Kurtis! Now it's time for the quiz! If you don't pass, I'll make you laugh!

Kurtis: NOES! I AM GONNA ESCAPES!

Gracie: Well if you do, I'll tackle you down and force you right back in the chair! There's no escaping your Spanish lesson! Hehehehehehehe!

*Kurtis escapes the tape and escapes the chair but as soon as he starts running, Gracie jumps on him and drags him back to the bed and puts him back on the chair and ties him to the chair. She replays the alphabetsum video*

Kurtis: LETS ME GOES!!!!

*While Kurtis is being  d for many hours, Let's check up on Red and the others at the diner!*

Red: I wonder how Gracie is doing with Kurtis. You guys wanna check?

Mike: Okay.

Cleetus: I got a diner to run so I'll be covering for me and Kurtis.

Red: Ok Cleetus.

*They head to Gracie's house and hear screaming inside the house. When they enter, They see Gracie having Kurtis tied to a chair, They see Kurtis's eyes forced open and they see Gracie forcing him to learn the alphabet. They also notice how obsessed with guys and animals and nature and painting Gracie is. Apparently there are paintings of animals and nature all throughout Gracie's house. Gracie is also obsessed with being a child but isn't as crazy as Sophie. Gracie's house looks like a colorful house that you'd expect a young kid to live in.*

Red: Uhhh. What's going on here?

*Gracie turns around and squeals with excitement as she sees Red and Mike*

Gracie: Just teaching Kurtis some Spanish! I might've had to encourage him a little bit!

Red: What the fuck is wrong with this place? Why does everything look weird here? Why are there pictures of kids everywhere, Why is there weird inspirational Buddhist quotes everywhere? AND WHY DOES GRACIE'S HOUSE HAVE PICTURE OF WEIRD NATURE THINGS AND ANIMALS! Mike…. I think we should get Kurtis and get the HECK OUT OF HERE. This girl is INSANE.

Mike: I AGREE. We need to get out of here as soon as possible.

Gracie: Hey Kurtis, Let's take a break for a while! You earned it! *Throws a sticker that says "You did great!" on Kurtis's shirt. Pats Kurtis's head and puts the phone on the bed. Goes to the kitchen and makes some tea and KAFFEE and MILCH.* You guys must be so thirsty! Would you like some CAWFEE or MILCH or WASSER?

Red: Uh no thank you, I'm a robot I can't drink.

Gracie: How about you, Mike?

Mike: Uhh. I'm sorry. I don't speak English. (That's a lie to get away from Gracie)

Gracie: Well then I'll make my good ol' friend Kurtis some food!

Kurtis: STAYS AWAY! YOU BETTER NOTS COME NEARS ME!

Gracie: I'll make Kurtis some MILCH.

Kurtis: NAW.

*Gracie pours a cup of MILCH. She goes back to her room, She pries Kurtis's   mothe open and makes him drink the milk.*

Gracie: DRINK THE MILCH. IT'S GOOD FOR YOU! If you don't drink it, I'll have to replay the video!

*Kurtis drinks the milch willingly*

Kurtis: ANYTHINGS TO GETS OUT OF HERES!

*Kurtis tries to escape but Gracie doesn't let him escape.*

Kurtis: REDS, MIKES, HELPS ME!!!

Mike: I'm sorry but I don't speak English. I'm outta here. *Leaves*

Red: Gracie seems to have everything under control. Imma go back to Cleetus but I'll check on you later. Bye.

*Red goes back to Cleetus*

Kurtis: AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! *Screaming*

Gracie: Now it's time to learn grammar! Repeat after me! *Confusing grammar*

Kurtis: NOES! LET ME GOES!

Gracie: Now let's watch Dora the explorer!

10 hours of   later.

Kurtis: NO MORE! I CAN'TS TAKES THIS!

Gracie: Let's learn some Spanish!

*Kurtis sees a pocket knife on the ground and he falls of the bed and grabs the pocket knife. Using the knife, He frees himself from the rope and starts to run out the room but Gracie follows.*

Gracie: NO! YOU NEED TO LEARN SPANISH!

*Kurtis runs out the house and he enters the lab and hides himself from Gracie.*

Sophie: Hey Kurtis, Why do you look so afraid?

Kurtis: I'M HIDSIN FROM GRACIE! SHE'S INSANESUM!

Sophie: Hmm. Maybe I can help?

Kurtis: REALSUMS? PLEASE HELPS ME! U CAN'TS TAKE HER ANYMORES!

Sophie: Hmm. Maybe if you become smort again you could say big words and scare her away?

Kurtis: I DON'T CARES! ANYTHING'S WILL WORK! I JUST HATES GRACIE!

*Sophie uses her magic to make Kurtis smart again*

Sophie: There you go. Now this should help you make the right choices.

Kurtis: OH THANK YOU SOPHIE! I NEED TO HIDE FROM GRACIE. BUT HOW?

Sophie: Just crash here! I won't mind!

Kurtis: THANK YOU SOPHIE!

*Gracie has stopped looking for Kurtis but is determined to help him learn Spanish. Gracie starts to stalk Kurtis.*

A few hours later.

Sophie: Ok Kurtis, I think Gracie is gone. You can leave if you want to.

Kurtis: Thanks again Sophie.

*Kurtis leaves the lab. He doesn't know Gracie is watching him via binoculars.*

Gracie: Ooo… look at Kurtis… He looks like he's headed to the diner! *Writing down notes and takes a picture of Kurtis and hangs it on my wall* I WILL GET KURTIS SOMEDAY AND WHEN I DO, HE WILL LEARN SPANISH!!!!!

*Kurtis enters the diner*

Kurtis: Um. Hello.

Cleetus: HEYS KURTIS! DIDS YOUS LEARNS SPANISHUMS?

Kurtis: No. Uh. Gracie is insane and basically I somehow escaped her house then I ran to the lab and Sophie gave me an IQ   friendst so now I'm smart.

Red: Why did you   friendst your IQ?

Kurtis: GRACIE BEING INSANE! I   friendSTED MY IQ SO I CAN RUN AWAY AND NEVER SEE HER AGAIN. Sophie said I can scare her away with knowledge?

Cleetus: Wells I'm still smorter thans you, YA GOOFBALL!

Kurtis: And how so?

Cleetus: (In Russian) I learned Russian and I can speak it perfectly!

Kurtis: Uhhhhh. What? I don't understand you…

Mike: He learn Russian.

Kurtis: Oh. Well then, I don't really care who's smarter than who. All I care about is GETTING AWAY FROM GRACIE! She's going to drive me crazy!

Cleetus: Oh! I thinks I hear Gracie nows!

*Kurtis runs out the diner screaming.*

Cleetus:  (In Russian) Hahahaha, I got him good.

Kurtis: AHHHHHHHHHH- *Doesn't see Gracie* THEY TRICKED ME!

*Gracie is still watching Kurtis through her window.*

Gracie: I see you, Kurtis! Hehehehe!

*Kurtis decides to go to Romone's palace cause he knows Romone won't mess with him.*

Kurtis: *Is now in front of the renovated palace* Wow. We did a good job on this! *Knocks on door*

Romone: *Opens door* Oh. Hi Kurtis. I wasn't expecting to see you…

Kurtis: Howdy. Uh so I have a bit of a problem.

Romone: Come in. And uh. Did you learn proper English or something? Cause I can understand you.

Kurtis: It's a long story.

*Kurtis enters the palace*

Romone: Uh so what exactly happened?

Kurtis: You know Gracie?

Romone: Yes I know Gracie… She's that lady who won't leave me or Red alone.

Kurtis: Well she locked me in the diner, forced me to drink some smoothies, took away my plate juice and left me in the hot diner for 5 hours and then came back and acted like she did nothing wrong! THEN TODAY SHE DRAGGED ME INTO HER HOUSE, TAPPED ME TO A CHAIR, FORCED ME TO LEARN SPANISH AND FORCE FED ME MILK, SHE THEN TIED ME TO THE CHAIR AS I ESCAPED THE TAPE. I eventually freed myself and ran to the lab but Gracie was chasing after me. AND THE WORST PART IS THAT HER HOUSE IS FULL OF PICTURES OF GUYS AND WEIRD STUFF! SHE'S CRAZY! So when I went to Sophie's lab, She gave me a smart spell to make it so I'm smart so then I went to the diner but the guys played a joke on me so I ran here to hide from Gracie as she's still after me.. So yeah. That's basically what happened…

Romone: Oh wow. She's crazier than Sophie used to be!

Kurtis: Yeah. And even when I was stupid, Sophie wasn't crazy as Gracie was.

Romone: You should try being direct to Gracie. Tell her "NO". You should learn to defend yourself. If Gracie wants you to do something you don't like, Tell her NO. And use self defense.

Kurtis: That's a good idea. But how can I defend myself? I'm just a weak little country feller!

Romone: Gracie isn't the boss of you. Just tell her how you feel.

Kurtis: You know what, Thank you Romone. I will go try that!

Romone: Anytime. But before you leave, Could you please reach some sugar for me? I need to make a cake.

Kurtis: Ok. *Does that and leaves palace afterwards.*

*Kurtis approaches Gracie's house. He can see her stalking him through the window.*

Kurtis: GRACIE OPEN UP.

*Gracie opens the door and grabs Kurtis and takes him to her room.*

Kurtis: PUT ME DOWN THIS INSTANT!

Gracie: No matter what you say, I'm not going to let you go without learning your Spanish lesson!

*Gracie ties Kurtis to the chair again*

Kurtis: LISTEN HERE GRACIE, YOU AIN'T THE BOSS OF ME! YOU CAN'T JUST FORCE ME TO LEARN SOME LANGUAGE I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT LEARNING, I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU. YOU UNTIE ME THIS INSTANT AND YOU GIVE ME SOME RESPECT!

Gracie: *Laughing* Stop kidding around! You know you are having so much fun!

Kurtis: SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP GRACIE!

Before she can do anything else, she hears the door being knocked. She opens up.

Gracie: Hello?

It's none other than Ash Wellington. He looks a bit tired.

Ash: Hello there, madam. I've noticed a bit o' unrelenting noise coming from your humble abode. I kindly ask t' please keep it down, as even show hosts have a sleep schedule.

Gracie: EEEEEEE! IT'S ASH WELLINGTON- Oh… sorry about all the noise! I was just trying to teach someone a new language, but they will not budge.

Ash: *seems suspicious but plays along* I see. Well, maybe I could help! I got a language o' my own, Irish that is. Maybe they want t' learn some?

Gracie: That would be great! Come on in!

Ash comes in and instantly sees how insane she is.

Ash: whoever is in here must have some extreme trauma *Sees Kurtis* So this is my new student? *winks at Kurtis to show he is acting*

Kurtis: uhhhh hey there. Who are you?

Ash: I am the one an only Ash Wellington t' ya! I'm here t' teach ya many things! Especially how t' escape from an insane persin. But before we begin, how about I show ya a magic trick?

Gracie: EEEEEEE! PICK ME PICK ME!

Ash: Sure thing dear! Now what I want ya t' do, *Pulls out giant saw box from his pocket somehow. The thing they do that magic trick where they cut the box in half and show the person.* is get in this here box an wait for my trick!

Gracie: EEEEEEE, OK!! *She gets in the box*

Ash: *Closes it and takes out his mysterious wand thingy and does a sealing spell on the box so that she cannot escape* just wait there as I get my trick ready! *unties Kurtis* alaight mister, here's the deal. We are getting outta here and you are gonna stay in my theater until this issue is solved, my theater is probably the most secure an safe place ya could hide. I've seen what this persin does an I sorta regret movin here, but I wanna help ya. So whadda ya say?

Kurtis: *shakes his hand* anything to get away from her, thanks mister!

Ash: it's a pleasure workin with ya!

They go to his theater.

Gracie: EEEEE! I CANT WAIT FOR THE TRICK!!!

10 minutes later…

Gracie: Wait… nothing's happening! *Frowns* DID ASH ABANDON ME??? WAAAAAAAAA!

Ash returns, Forgetting something He had.

Ash: Sorry to keep ya waiting! I was just getting my saw, I couldn't find it. Hehe…

Gracie: Ok!

He slowly takes the box to his rich car and puts her in the trunk. He drives the car all the way to the lake at full speed and ejects himself at the last moment. The box falls into the lake.

Ash: that outta do it! Imma buy a new car. *leaves*

Gracie: *Falls on Mariana*

Mariana: WHAT THE?! *Sees box and screams in anger* WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP TRASHING MY HOME???? I AM THIS CLOSE TO DESTROYING THIS TOWN… *Hears movement and opens* WHAT THE?

Gracie: GET ME OUT OF THIS!!!!

Mariana breaks the box and sees Gracie. She puts a bubble over her head so she can breathe and talk

Mariana: WHAT IS THIS, WHO THREW HUMAN TRASH INTO MY HOME?

Gracie: ASH WELLINGTON! HE WAS MY IDOL AND HE BETRAYED ME!!!!! WAAAAAAA!!!

Mariana: SHUT YOUR   mothe HUMAN! I AM IN NO MOOD FOR THIS!

Gracie: O-ok…. S-Sorry…

Mariana: *Sighs, she seems sad* now… this Ash guy, is this his? *shows his rich car on the castle*

Gracie: Y-Yeah! He threw me in! All I wanted to do was help a friend named Kurtis learn a language then all of a sudden I was put in a magic box and Ash said he'd be back to do a magic trick but then he threw me in this lake! I didn't mean to invade your home!

Mariana: …Ok I- …I missed a lot. Can you like, summarize everything I missed? Cause I swear I saw a giant spider running around yesterday.

Gracie: Well this all started when I was just walking around and I went to a let store to buy a pet! He was a cute kitty cat/spider and everyone hated the spider so they tried   ing it but then I went to a lab to get my spider pet some immortality but he became evil and ran around Oakland. Then, I think you came in and   ed it. After all that, I went back to my house to worship Ash Wellington- I mean watch Ash Wellington. Then the next day I visited my good friend Cleetus at his diner and he needed help with Kurtis because Kurtis was needing to learn a language so I got Kurtis, Brought him to my house and then I tried teaching him but he ran away from me! Then Ash Wellington appeared and that's when I was thrown in the water and hit your house.

Mariana: Well. A lot has definitely happened. So this Ash guy just threw you in my home without a care in the world?

Gracie: Well I kinda went too far with teaching my friend Kurtis some Spanish so Ash kinda assumed I was insane and threw me in the lake BUT I'M NOT INSANE! I'M JUST… Well. Obsessed with a lot of things… and I don't really control myself and I may have a bit of problems here or there, BUT WHY WOULD ASH JUST THROW ME IN A LAKE? DID HE WANT TO    ME OR SOMETHING? I just don't understand why he would do that! I'm sorry for interrupting you like this, I just uh. Have no idea what I do. I'm stupid.

Mariana: You are crazy? What do you mean?

Gracie: Well I might be a little little little tiny bit obsessed with guys and I may have been a little bit too obsessed with helping people so I might've held Kurtis against his will to learn Spanish… Uhh and I might've scarred him for life… BUT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS HOW HARD IT IS TO BE LONELY! I HAVE NO FRIENDS 😭 EVERYONE HATES ME! 😭😭😭 WHY CAN'T I GET FRIENDS???

Mariana: Um. I don't know. I don't know!

Gracie: IF ONLY THERE WAS A PERSON WHO COULD JUST DEAL WITH ME AND MY IMPERFECTIONS. THEN I WOULDN'T BE SO INSANE!!! But uh. I can pay for the damages of your house if you need to. I just don't understand why Ash would throw me in the lake! But if I have to work to pay the damages, I most certainly will.

Mariana: Well. Um. I don't really know much about who you are so I don't really know if I can "help" with your situation… but as for my home… Since Ash threw you in my home, He will have to pay for the damages. As for you though, You need to work on your problems with someone. Like a therapist. I don't want to see another car in my lake again… Now, Where is this Ash person?

Gracie: OH THANK YOU! As for Ash however, I don't know where Ash is…

Mariana: Well then, I'll make a deal with you, Gracie. If you find Ash and you bring him to me, I'll grant you one free wish. Now if you do not bring him to me and/or find him, Then I will make you fix my castle and you'll be locked up in jail. And because I am generous, I'll give you as much time as you need. Do you have any clue where Ash lives or anything?

Gracie: He lives in Ireland.

Mariana: Well then Gracie, Your journey sounds far. I shall give you as much time as you need. When you have found Ash, Use this *Gives Gracie a button to teleport back to the lake.* This will bring you and Ash back. You just have to grab Ash and push the button otherwise it'll just teleport you back to the lake. Also, Take this. *Gives Gracie a water powered jetpack* This Jetpack can help you quickly get to where you need to be. You will need to refill it every 2 hours. Just go to a body of water and place it in the water and it should automatically refill. Also, Take this. *Gives Gracie a electric scooter she found when someone threw it in* in case your jetpack is out of fuel and you need to find water, Use this electric scooter. You'll need it. The electric scooter not only lasts 6 hours, But it has a nice drink and food compartment complete with snacks that magically refill every hour. That way you will be well hydrated and fed on your journey. Also the scooter charges in the sun so just place it in the sun to charge it. It should take 30 mins to charge. I wish you good luck, Gracie. You'll need it. Now. Do not disappoint me.

*Gracie is teleported back on the land with all her resources. Gracie puts the jetpack on her back in case she needs it. Gracie sticks the button in her pocket and starts to ride the scooter to Ireland.*

Gracie: I'M COMING FOR YOU, ASH WELLINGTON!!!!!!!!

*Gracie hops on the scooter and pushes the "Go" button on the scooter. The scooter begins to move. On the scooter, There are various speeds. Gracie goes to the highest speed which is 50 miles per hour as she is very stupid*

Gracie: WOOHOO! THIS SCOOTER IS FAST!

*Eventually, The scooter runs out of fuel and Gracie recharges it in the sun.*

*Gracie eventually arrives in Ireland.*

Gracie: Now to find the theatre…

*Gracie sees the Ash Wellington theater and enters. She's still on her scooter and it is still going 50 miles an hour so she ends up breaking the doors down. Gracie stops the scooter and parks it. Gracie then sees Ash Wellington and Kurtis.*

Gracie: NOT SO FAST, ASH WELLINGTON!

Ash: *Silent* Was that supposed t’ be dramatic?

Gracie: There was supposed to be dramatic music! HOLD ON. LET ME RETRY!

*Gracie re-enters.*

Gracie: NOT SO FAST, ASH WELLINGTON! *Dramatic music*

Ash: *Gasp* GRACIE? HOW'D YA GET HERE?

Gracie: I DROVE ON THIS SCOOTER TO IRELAND!

Ash: YOU ARE NOT GETTING KURTIS BACK IF THAT'S WHAT YA HERE FOR! And… HOW DID YOU ESCAPE THE BOX?

Gracie: Well Mariana freed me!

Ash: Well ya aren't getting back Kurtis. He's traumatized by you.

Gracie: Oh I'm not here for him. I'm here to show you a magic trick! But Kurtis has to participate as well.

Ash: Why him?

Gracie: Just because!

Ash: Um. Ok. Well hurry this magic trick o’ yours up. My show starts soon.

Gracie: Just hold my hand and Kurtis has to hold your hand!

Ash: Why?

Gracie: It will show us a vision!

Ash: Um. Ok.

*Ash holds Gracie's hand and Kurtis holds Ash's hand. Gracie pushes the button and they are immediately teleported back to the lake. They are pulled to the bottom and air bubbles are put on their heads.*

Mariana: Hello Gracie. Did you find Ash?

Gracie: Mhm!

Ash: Hey what's the big idea here?

Gracie: I TRICKED YOU JUST AS YOU TRICKED ME! AND NOW YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID TO MARIANA!

Mariana: That's right, Gracie. Ash. Do you recognize this "car" on my HOUSE? *points to a rich car*

Ash: Uh. *Sees the damage of the house* OH! Uh I can explain, Ya see I was uhh…

Mariana: SILENCE. ASH WELLINGTON. Because you destroyed my HOUSE. You are required to fix it. As for Gracie, You get one free wish as promised.

Ash: WAIT HOLD ON A SECOND. SO SHE GETS A FREE WISH AND I HAVE T’ CLEAN UP YA HOUSE? HOW'S THAT FAIR?

Mariana: Oh I don't know, YOU CRASHED YOUR CAR INTO MY HOUSE.

Ash: GRRR.I HATE YOU GRACIE.

Gracie: And to think I looked up to you, Ash…

Ash: You are a psychopath, Gracie.

Gracie: NO I'M NOT. I just have issues! Now anyways, I am ready my wish.

Ash: Oh man I wonder what stupid wish Gracie will be waisting on today!

Gracie: Well I was going to wish for Mariana's house to be completely repaired and for us to forget all this BUT SINCE ASH WANTS TO BE SUCH A MEANIE, I know exactly what to wish for…

Mariana: What is your one wish? It can be anything. Choose wisely.

Gracie: No limits?

Mariana: None. You just can't mess with time or the universe.

Gracie: Hmm… Let me think for a second… *thinking* so I have a lot I'd love to wish for. But I have one wish. So I have to use this wisely… think Gracie, Think… *after thinking for a minute* I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO WISH FOR. I'm ready, Mariana.

Mariana: State your one wish.

Gracie: Ok this is gonna be a long wish so I'll just say it all at once. I wish for Mariana's house to be repaired, Kurtis's trauma to be removed, and for Mariana to decide Ash's fate. And also for everything to go back to the way it was before Ash appeared today.

Mariana: Ok… based on what I am hearing here, you wished for… *Counting with tentacles* 4 wishes. Do you think I am stupid or something? I may be a sea creature who knows little to nothing of human culture, but I KNOW MATH! You can only choose one of those wishes. And i'm not a genie or anything so do not expect anything crazy.

Gracie: Fine. I wish that your castle is repaired but you also decide Ash's fate. this counts as one wish.

Mariana: You are the most infuriating human i have ever met, but fine. I already decided his fate anyway, so… *Uses magic to repair the castle* I was kinda in a bad mood today and forgot I can basically do whatever I want here.

Gracie: So let me get this straight… You made me go on a long quest just for nothing? I literally just wished to repair your castle and for everything to go back to normal and this is how you respond? I thought you'd be a lot more happier about me fixing your castle and trying to make things right…

Mariana: *Giggles* I was just messing around. I sure love abusing the intelligence and loyalty of humans!! It gets me so giddy! You definitely made me happy today, but my time with you has come to an end. Go, shoo now.

Gracie: Wait… WHAT ABOUT ASH’S FATE? HE CANT GET OFF SCOT FREE


Mariana: I do not care about your human drama. Go before I change my mind.

Gracie: Then I'll decide his fate….

*they leave the lake*

Gracie: I'll be back for you, Ash. I'm going to go take Kurtis back to the diner… STAY RIGHT THERE.

Ash: Fine, whateva. You are now permanently banned from seeing any of my shows, live and TV. Hmph. *Crosses arms*

Gracie takes Kurtis back to the diner then comes back to Ash to decide his fate.

Gracie: Now here's what I was going to decide for you. I WAS going to be nice and donate some money to your theater as I love your shows, but after seeing THIS today, I'm just gonna give you the button to go back to Ireland.

Ash: Huh. Ya know, that is more helpful than it does   hug. Thanks a lot lady!

Gracie: I no longer want to ever watch your shows anyway. I'd rather watch goat story 2 with Cheese.

Ash: As much as I'd like to fight ya about it, I do quite enjoy that movie. It's an old classic.

Gracie: *Throws the button at you* Now go back to your "show". And don't ever talk to me again. *Marches back to my house angrily*

Ash: Ya know what? I think I'll stay. *Does a thing with his staff and poofs away like a magician. He feels something weird, like he remembers something from a past he didn't have. (He remembers the sociopath version of himself) He shrugs it off and prepares for another show.* (Gracie almost reawakened his sociopathism)

*Meanwhile with Kurtis in the diner*

Kurtis: CLEETUS- *doesn't see Cleetus*

Cleetus: *Talking to Mike in Russian upstairs*

Kurtis: Cleetus? You here? *Goes upstairs and sees Cleetus* Oh, Hello Cleetus.

Cleetus: pryvit.

Kurtis: I forgot you still speak Russian… I guess I better learn a language too… BUT NOT SPANISH. *Kurtis grabs Cleetus's phone as Kurtis don't got no phonesum.*

Kurtis: IT'S IN RUSSIAN? AHHHHHHHHHHH! *Puts the phone back on the counter.* Well I better go buy me a phone then…

*Kurtis buys a new phone and gets Duolingo*

Kurtis: Hmmmmmmm.. what language to learn? *Notices a language called "German". German looks interesting. I think I'll learn it! Looks easier than French anyway…

*Kurtis hops on Duolingo*

Kurtis: I wonder if anyone else is on Duolingo. *Sees Romone is on Duolingo learning Italian. Also sees Nasha learning English, but doing terrible as she cannot determine the difference between their, there and they’re (Me too)*

Kurtis: Time to start unit 1 of German!

Duolingo: Time to learn German! How many hours do you want to learn?

Kurtis: uhh I'll choose 30 minutes a day.

Duolingo: Let’s start simple! *Shows three words and a picture of milk* Translate the following into german! *3 choices are milch, kaffee, and wasser.*

Kurtis: Uhhhhhhhhhhhh *Presses milch cause it has an M in it.*

Duolingo: Correct! Next question: Translate the following sentence; Milk and coffee, please! *Shows the word bank for Kurtis to choose*

Kurtis: UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH *Does “Milch und Kaffee, bitte!”*

Duolingo: Correct! *100 translations of milk and coffee, please! later…* translate the sentence into german-

Kurtis: I SWEAR IF IT IS MILCH UND KAFFEE BITTE ONE MORE TIME…

Duolingo: Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth. If you still even remember that name. But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust of   has driven you in endless circles. Chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber. Always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach. But, you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends. And to you, my brave volunteer. Who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although, there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered. And the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away, as the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still, and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps, warmth waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you… The darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the Devil waiting, old friend. My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to  , no one was there to lift you up in their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you? I should have known, you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest, for you, and for those you have carried in your arms. This ends. For all of us. End communication.

Kurtis: What… *Looks at word bank terrified with the amount of words.*

*Kurtis decides to learn a different language. He tries learning French. (Oh no. This don't look good for Kurtis.)*

Kurtis: Hmm. I'm going to try French! It can't be that hard, Right?

Duolingo: Today we will learn the alphabet!


Kurtis: OH MY- WHAT THE HECK IS THIS? AHHHHHHH NOW THIS IS  ! I'M GOING TO LEARN SOMETHING NOT SO CURSED!

*Kurtis decides to try to learn Ukrainian.*

Meanwhile in the lab… YA has finally lost it. He is now speaking German and saying NEIN a lot. He has also just lost himself in his own mind. Sophie decides to enter his brain to fix him once and for all. She also uses Temp’s help, since she cannot really change his brain.

YA: AHHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHSHSHSHSHSHSHSAAAAAA *Creaming*

Temp: Time to fix this.

*They enter mind. They see YC and YA doing a SCAWY animatronic video.*

YA: HEY GUYS IT'S ME AARON AND TODAY I'M GOING TO CATCH RATTY BOY TOY ON CAMERA MOVING AGAIN!

YC: *Crazy screaming. Chasing crazy kitty like maniac*

Crazy kitty: Why do I even do these videos?

Temp: So. Um. I don't know if we are in the right memory?

Sophie: I think this is it! YA is about to have the video ruined and that's when he's gonna go crazy.

*The camera breaks and YA screams and starts doing the dolphin screaming. Suddenly the crazy kitty is filming him running to his room and breaking a window with a ball then proceeding to film him breaking a door with a mallet. THEN ATTACKING THE CRAZY KITTY WITH A BALL AND DESTROYING THE CAMERA. Finally YA starts to upload hundreds of videos of him going more insane.*

YA: CRRRRRRIIIIIIINNNNNNGE!

Tara: *Going insane* I think my son is mentally insane.

Temp: Welp. I never knew YA was so insane as a kid. Well technically he's still a kid as he can't really age in Oakland. So uh. I'll just uh. Somehow fix him.. to be honest I don't know what to do.

Sophie: Um. I don't know what to do either… Should I just use my magic to fix this and we just move on with our day?

Temp: Yeah.. I really don't know what to do. Just do your magic thing or whatever.

*Souphie fixes YA's brain with her magic.*

*They exit the brain and Temp goes back to Spruceville or whatever he was doing before this.*

Sophie: YA, Would you like some strawberry milk?

YA: YEAWH! I WOULD WOVE SOME     milk!

Sophie: Ok! Go get it! *Throws the strawberry milk across the lab.*

*YA runs over to it like a dog and slurps it all down. It is empty in 6 seconds.*

YA: MORE     milk PWEASE!!!!!!

Sophie: Uh. We're kinda all out….

YA: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

*All the Oakland kids go crazy but Sophie ends up finding another big pack of strawberry milk and they calm down.*

Sophie: I'm just going to Romone's. You guys can do whatever…

*Sophie goes to Romone's. She sees Gracie spying on Kurtis and decides to go see what's happening.*

Sophie: What are you doing, Gracie?

Gracie: OH HEY SOPHIE! I'M JUST SPYING ON KURTIS. HE NEEDS TO LEARN HIS SPANISH!

Sophie: Uh Gracie, Are you mentally okay?

Gracie: YES! I'M GOOD!

Sophie: Why don't we go to your house and just.. talk.

Gracie: *Pays attention to Sophie and is really excited. Usual Gracie excitement again* EEEEEEE! LET'S GO TO MY HOUSE!

*Sophie and Gracie go to house*

Sophie: So uh. Why are you spying on Kurtis?

Gracie: HE NEEDS TO LEARN SPANISH!!!!

Sophie: Are you sure?

Gracie: HAHAHAHAHA, YEAH!

Sophie: Tell me the truth, Gracie. I can tell something is up…

Gracie: HEHEHEHHEE I'M FINE!

Sophie: Nuh uh.

Gracie: I AM PERFECTLY ME! Hehehehehhe!

Sophie: NUH UH.

Gracie: YUH HUH!

Sophie: What is something you wouldn't want me to do if I was going to find out the truth?

Gracie: you could just totally shrink down into my ear and find out the truth. BUT DON'T DO IT!

Sophie: Thanks, I will!

Gracie: NUH UH! DON'T YOU DARE GO IN THERE!

*Sophie enters Gracie's ear*

Gracie: HEY GET OUT OF MY EAR! EEEEEEE.

Sophie: *Eyes widen as I see what is inside Gracie's mind* W-What is this? WHY ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT KURTIS SO MUCH? DO YOU LOVE HIM?

Gracie: Hehehehehehehe! Yeah! Maybe a lil bit!

Sophie: *Goes to look for origin and opens a door and walks in memory*

*Origin begins*

13 years ago in Potnuk… Gracie's original parents were not around much and Gracie was adopted by a nice couple who raised her to be really kind and caring.

Present time: 7 years.

Gracie is playing with some boys.

Gracie: Hehehe! You can't catch me!

*After playing, She walks home but is walking down a dark creepy alleyway. She sees some boys that are teens and are in a gang.*

Gracie: Hello! My name is Gracie! Who are you?

The gang members beat Gracie up and take her money.

Gracie: WAAAAAA! WHY THEY MEANIES????

*Over the course of many years in Potnuk, Gracie is  d by various people. One day though, She sees an ad about Oakland and decides to move there.*

She does.

*That's really it for her origin. She had a not so bad childhood but she never became crazy from it. Though she was very dumb and did drop out of school to obsess over boys and become a "kind and compassionate person"*

Sophie: Wow. Well that wasn't really much of an origin. I wonder if Gracie is secretly evil.. hmm. Let me look…

*Sophie looks through Gracie and doesn't see any sort of evil in her. Though she is very obsessive over boys but nothing really crazy about her. She is very very over excited though.*

*Sophie exits Gracie's mind*

Sophie: Well. I didn't really find much about you.

Gracie: Did you think I was evil? Because I'm not! I am just a nice person who is a little bit obsessed with boys!

Sophie: Hmm. Well what if I could find someone who might be able to be your boyfriend?

Gracie: *Eyes widen in excitement* OOOO! REALLY?

Sophie: Mhm! I mean, You helped me become normal so it's time I help you!

Gracie: Yay! Thank you! How could I ever repay you?

Sophie: Only obsess over your friend or boyfriend. Not anyone else. K?

Gracie: Ok! So where is this boy?

Sophie: Well we're going to see multiple guys.

Gracie: I see! Well, Lead the way!

*Sophie first takes Gracie to the goofy fellers megabarn*

Gracie: What are we doing here? Are we here to see Kurtis? 😄😄😄😄😄

*Sophie takes Gracie to Cleetus*

Sophie: Hey Cleetus! Could you come here for a second?

*Cleetus comes to Sophie*

Cleetus: Uhh. Yeauhs?

Sophie: I was thinking… You and Gracie really haven't gotten to know each other much. Why don't you guys chat for a bit?

Cleetus: UHHHHS. O-O-Okays…

*Sophie goes to Kurtis to chat or something.*

Gracie: Cleetus, Be honest…. Do you love me?

Cleetus: Uhhhhhhhh. Yeauhs. Kindas.

Gracie: *Kisses Cleetus on the cheek* Listen… I don't really want a boyfriend or date… I really like you as a friend, Cleetus. I just… I am not really ready to date. I just prefer you as a friend. Do you understand?

Cleetus: Yeauhs. I do… buts you broke my hearts…

Gracie: *Eyes widen. I then hug Cleetus extremely tight* Please don't be so sad! I am still going to be your friend! And in fact a good friend!

Cleetus: R-Realums?

Gracie: Yes. Realums. But I can find you a date if that's what you want.

Cleetus: yous do that? For mes?

Gracie: Mhm! Your my best friend!

Cleetus: IM YOUR BESTS FRIENDS?

Gracie: Mhm! Everyone is my best friend! But you are number one.

Cleetus: I.. I.. I.. I- WELL YEEEEEEEHAAAW, FELLERS!! I'M SOES HAPPY!

*Gracie smiles*

Gracie: Well cleetus, I gotta get going. Sophie is trying to do some sort of thing. I'll talk to you later though!

Cleetus: OKAYS!

*Sophie and Gracie leave the megabarn.

*Sophie takes Gracie to the lab and she enters Tick's room.*

Tick: *Sitting in bed and being depressed about something*

Sophie: Well here's Tick. He's been awfully depressed about something lately and I can't seem to cheer him up. I was hoping you could chat to him cause tbh I've done all I can do.

Gracie: Well, Ok!

*Sophie exits Tick's room*

Sophie: I really hope he gets better soon…. Welp! Let's hope Gracie handles it. Now, I'm going to go make some strawberry milk so those kids don't go crazy on me again…

*Meanwhile with Gracie and Tick*

Gracie: Hello there, Tick! Sophie said you aren't feeling so well! Well I'm here to cheer you up!

*Gracie sits next to Tick and hugs him.*

Tick: GO AWAY, GRACIE. I DON'T CARE.

Gracie: No! I'm not budging.

Tick: WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? A MILLION DOLLARS?

Gracie: Mm Mm! Nope! I want you to feel happy! Now tell me what's up or else I'm not letting go of you and I'm not going away until you are happy.

Tick: GR… FINE. Well, I'm depressed because I was remembering a brother I used to have. I forgot much about him. His origin was very tragic.

Gracie: Oh no! That's horrible! What happened to him?

Tick: He basically got kidnapped by my real parents and injected with something that made him sound like he's 80 and look 80. I forgot his name and I don't remember much about him. All I know is that he rhymes with my name.

Gracie: How old would he be today?

Tick: 30.

Gracie: Hmm. Well I'll investigate about this and let you know more about what I find. Don't you worry my little Tucky!

Tick: DID YOU JUST CALL ME TUCKY??????????????????

Gracie: Uh. Oops!! Sorry!

Tick: *Sigh* DON'T CALL ME THAT. ok?

Gracie: Okie dokie, Tick! I'll go ahead and investigate.

*Gracie goes to investigate about the whole thing with Tick*

Gracie: Hmm. So if I was to find Tick's brother, How would I do that? Hmm. So he rhymes with Tick.. but who else would rhyme with Tick?

*Yick has heard someone talk about Tick. He comes out his hiding place behind the lab. Apparently he's just been living in a tent behind Sophie's for some time and nobody ever noticed him. :(*

*Gracie notices Yick*

Gracie: Oh, Hello sir! Are you new to Oakland?

Yick: *I run off*

Gracie: Huh? Wait! Come back!

*Gracie tackles Yick to the ground. Yick groans. He seems to be ashamed of his voice. He doesn't talk.*

Gracie: Sir, Are you alright? I'm sorry if I tackled you. I just wanted to stop you… I've just never seen you around here. Where are you from?

Yick: …

Gracie: Sir? Can you speak?

Yick: *I cover myself*

Gracie: Hey, It's okay! You don't have to be afraid! Now, Can you speak? If you don't answer in 3 seconds, I'll tickle you!

Yick: Fine.

Gracie: Yay!

Yick: I'm sorry for hiding, M'lady. The name's Yick. I am not new. I've been here since Tick has been here.

Gracie: Wait a second…. You kinda look like Tick but more older…

Yick: That's because I'm his brother.

Gracie: How are you his brother if you are 80 and he's…. Wait. How old is Tick? DARN I FORGOT TO ASK SOPHIE!

Yick: He's 26. I'm actually 30 years old. UGH. I HATE HAVING THIS VOICE!!!

Gracie: YOU'RE 30???

Yick: *Sighs* Yes. But there's a reason why I look this way…

Gracie: What's the reason?

Yick: Why would I tell you?

Gracie: Come on, You can trust me!!!

Yick: I'm sorry ma'am but I do not know you. Why would I tell you about my DARK past?

Gracie: You had a DARK past?

Yick: Ok listen lady. Go bother someone else. I'm literally not in the mood for your presence. I have to go back to my tent now and deal with this BODY. I hate looking and sounding old.

Gracie: NO. YOU AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE. *Hugs Yick* NOW TELL ME WHAT YOUR PAST IS ABOUT.

Yick: NO. You aren't getting anything from me!

Gracie: Then I guess I'm going in your head!

Yick: Haha, Yeah right. Sure lady, Go into my mind. YOU CAN'T DO THAT AND UNLESS YOU FIND A WAY IN, YOU AREN'T GETTING ME TO TELL YOU. Now why don't you leave me alone?

Gracie: *Shrinks and enters Yick's mind*

Yick: You know what, I give up. Fine, Go into my head. See if I care. I'm going back to my tent to sleep.

*Gracie looks at Yick's memories and sees his mind*

*She sees Yick's origin*

Gracie: AAAAAAAAAA! THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

*Gracie hops out Yick's head and sees he is sleeping in his tent*

Gracie: *screams in Yick's ear* HELLO!

Yick: *Wakes up. Screams* HUH? WHAT'S GOING ON? I SURRENDER- *Turns around and sees Gracie* Oh. It's the crazy lady again.

Gracie: Hewwo! I was wondering, Since you are not really happy in your life, Maybe I could reverse your voice and weird magic injections so you look young again?

Yick: Really?

Gracie: Mhm! *Gets out one of the smoothies* this can help you get your voice back!

Yick: Really? That would be great!

*Yick drinks the smoothie and somehow the effects of his weird old age thing go away and Yick looks like he's 30 and young. He now has a young voice and appearance*

Yick: Did it work?

Gracie: OH MY GOSH! EEEEE! IT WORKS! YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME!

Yick: My voice even sounds normal!

Gracie: Mhm! Now if you need anything else, You can always come to my house!

Yick: Ok.

*Gracie goes back to the lab to talk to Tick*

Gracie: So I found your brother and I got rid of that injection he had. His name's Yick by the way.

Tick: HOW DID I NOT REMEMBER HIS NAME?

Gracie: I dunno. But uh. The real question is, Are you feeling better?

Tick: I guess so.

Gracie: Want a smoothie?

Tick: no.

Gracie: Come on! You look thirsty! Just try it!

Tick: NO. NO IS MY FINAL ANSWER.

Gracie: *Grabs a smoothie and feeds it to Tick*

Tick: MM- *Drinks it all. Swallows* THIS IS SO AMAZING! I was expecting it to be like strawberry milk. But it tastes so good for some reason! And hey, My depression is gone!! Just don't ever come see me again. Or else….

Gracie: Okay! Well I better go now, BYEEEEE!

*She goes back to Sophie *

Sophie: You ready to see the final person? Now, Just to warn you, He's a little awkward and shy around new people….

Gracie: I LOVE SHY PPL!!!!

Sophie: Ok!

*Sophie takes Gracie to a 15 year old, childish version of one of the Aarons. He's the "abused Aaron". Acts a lot like YA when he was actually YA.*

*As Sophie opens the door, The AYA (Alternate young Aaron) hides from Sophie and Gracie as this is the "afwaid of gwirls Aaron".*

Sophie: Also Gracie, He may be a little scared of girls and magic.

Gracie: OH MY GOSH, HE'S EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN KURTIS!

Sophie: So, Who have you picked as your friend/boyfriend?

Gracie: What's this guy's name?

Sophie: AYA.

Gracie: EEEEEE! I'M SO EXCITED!!! HE'S COMING HOME WITH ME AND WE'LL WATCH SOME TV OR DO WHATEVER HE WANTS! (Gracie is actually 17)

*Gracie picks up AYA and she takes him back to her house*

*Gracie enters house and takes AYA to her room and Gracie feeds him a smoothie to help him calm down*

Meanwhile at the goofy fellers megabarn

Cleetus: HEY KURTIS, IM GONNA MAKES A SMOOTHUMS FOR THE CUSTOMERS! I HAVES A OLD FAMILUM RECIPES! IT'S CALLED PEENUT BUTTA ANDS CHOCOLUT SMOOTHUMS WITH NANERS! ITS GOOD FOR HEALTHUMS!

Kurtis: I'd love to try it. But uh. I'm learning some German. Come let me know when it's ready.

Cleetus: Nuh uh.

Kurtis: Okay then. I'll get it myself.

*Cleetus prepares the smoothie. Meanwhile, Tara smells the peanut butter smoothie to come criticize it.*

Tara: IS THAT A SMOOTHIE I SMELL? I NEED TO FIND THAT AND TRY IT!

*She does the weird sniffer thing. Y know, The Goat story with cheese king running to the Cheech.*

*Tara enters the restaurant*

Tara: DOES MY NOSE DECEIVE ME? OR IF NEED BE, I SMELL A SMOOTHIE OVER HERE!!

Cleetus: Uhhs. Yeauhs. I am making a PEENUT BUTTA ANDS CHOCOLUT SMOOTHUMS WITH NANERS! ITS GOOD FOR HEALTHUMS!

Tara: Is it ready yet?

Cleetus: Uh huh. *Puts it in a cup and brings it to Tara.*

*Tara tries the smoothie*

Tara: BLEH. THIS IS THE WORST SMOOTHIE I'VE EVER TRIED!!!

Cleetus: HOWS DOES YOU NOT LIKES IT?

Tara: EVERYTHING IS WRONG WITH THIS! THERE IS TOO MUCH PEANUT BUTTER! Though I do like Reese's pieces and peanut butter M and M's. I also like crunchy and soft peanut butter in the container!

Cleetus: YOUS LIKES ALL FORMSUM OF PEANUT BUTTA EXCEPT FOR WHEN ITS INS A SMOOTHUMS?!?!?

Tara: Yup.

Cleetus: GETS OUTTA MY DINER!!!!

*Meanwhile, Two new mysterious people arrive in Oakland. There's Oliver and Wyatt.*

Oliver is skipping happily to Oakland and Wyatt is staring deeply into the sky, while slowly moving to the town.

Oliver doesn't notice Wyatt.

*Oliver accidentally enters Gracie's house*

Gracie: *Sees Oliver and screams in joy* EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!! WHO ARE YOU?

Oliver: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! I'M SO EXCITED! WHO ARE YOU? And who's this?

Gracie: This is my new friend, AYA! He's shy.

Oliver: Mind if I help you out?

Gracie: Sure! Btw, What's your name?

Oliver: I'm Oliver! And who are you?

Gracie: I'm Gracie! Nice to meet ya, Oliver! Are you new here?

Oliver: Mhm! I'm new here!

Gracie: Well why don't I give ya a tour?

Oliver: Who will watch AYA?

Gracie: Sophie can babysit him for a minute!

Oliver: Okay!

*Gracie goes to the lab and explains the situation to Sophie. Sophie agrees to watch AYA*

Gracie: So, Here's the lab and all the kids that live here!

*Oliver runs to all the kids and excitedly runs around them and jumps in joy*

Gracie: I see you are excited!

Oliver: Mhm! *Runs back to Gracie and hugs.* I love this town!

*Gracie takes Oliver to all the rooms. (After exploring all the rooms except the happy room and Tick's room)*

Gracie: So this is the happy room. Nobody comes in here but sometimes Sophie brings in the kids for some Strawberry milk and happiness!

Oliver: Ooo!

*They enter Tick's room*

Oliver: *Goes to the other side of the bed and looks into Tick's eyes* Why does he look so sad? 😥

Gracie: He is always sad unfortunately. I have made him happy earlier but I didn't realize he was sad again. I just assume he's always sad since I never see him happy. Please don't call him Tucky as he doesn't like that name.

Oliver: I wanna help him! Lemme help him! *Jumping up and down, Excited*

Gracie: Sure! I'll stay in here as I can't leave any kid unsupervised.

Oliver: Ok! *Grabs a chair and sits right in front of Tick where I look directly in his eyes which were just staring at a wall but are now looking directly at Oliver. Oliver grabs a four leaf clover from his pocket and puts it in Tick's hand. Oliver then looks at Tick who is starting to be angry. Oliver grabs a magic potion from his pocket and shows it to him. The potion glows a deep blue color that actually looks kinda beautiful. Tick doesn't seem to care though.*

Oliver: He's just so sad! Why is he looking so sad?

Gracie: I don't know. I think he just needs a friend.

Oliver: Well I'll be his friend!

*Tick looks at Oliver and for once doesn't feel annoyed at him as he doesn't seem to be as annoying as Gracie.*

Gracie: So before you come back to Tick or hang out with me and AYA, Let's give you the rest of the tour!

Oliver: Okay!

*They leave Tick's room and tour the rest of Oakland including Spruceville. They tour Red's and Romone's last.*

*After exploring the town, They go to the remaining areas they haven't explored. Red's and Romone's.*

Gracie and Oliver enter Red's*

Red: Welcome to Red's pizzeria- *Sees Gracie* HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU? STAY OUT OF THIS RESTAURANT!

Gracie: Okay! I'm not staying here for long, Ok? I'm just giving Oliver a tour!

Red: Who's Oliver?

*Red looks down and sees Oliver*

Oliver: Hello! I'm Oliver!

Red: Oh dear. He won't be so bad, I can feel it… somehow. Well, I welcome you to my establishment. You can find the finest pizza and entertainment in this wonderful place. Would you like to try some pizza? It's on the house since you are new here.

Oliver: Thank you!

Red makes him a simple cheese pizza with bacon.

Red: Enjoy.

*Oliver eats it and hugs Red.*

Oliver: Thank you!!!

Gracie: Alright Red, We'll go ahead and leave now.

*They leave*

Oliver: So I guess I'll get back to Tick now.

Gracie: Ok! I'll get back to my AYA!

*Gracie returns to AYA and Oliver goes to Tick*

*Meanwhile with Wyatt*

He is super confused about where he is, he thinks it's still better than his house. He is lost. He wanders around and finds a lake. He looks into the water, pondering to himself why he is still alive in his meaningless existence. He notices something bubbling up the water. There is a large tentacle that hits the shore. He does not react to it, as he has no idea what he is seeing. Mariana appears from the shore.

Mariana: YOU. STAY OFF OF MY HOME!

He stares at her with a blank expression. In his brain, he is super confused about what he is looking at. He thinks it may attack him, but he doesn't care. Mariana notices he is not scared at all.

Mariana: I SAID.. GET OUT OF MY HOME!!! *Creates a tidal wave that washes Wyatt away*

Wyatt gets up and coughs water out. He is intrigued by what happened and returns to her.

Mariana: GRRRR STOP COMING BACK!!

He stares at her some more. Mariana cools herself off. She notices how dead he looks in his eyes. She feels a little bad, but tries to resist it.

Mariana: Why must you keep returning?

Wyatt looks down.

Mariana: *sighs* you must be fun at parties. *sits down (somehow) next to him* at least you aren't so annoying. Who are you anyway?

Wyatt stares at her, still silent. Mariana grows impatient. She uses her mind reading ability to read his mind.

Wyatt: *mind* I am Wyatt.

Mariana: I see. What's up with this silent act?

Wyatt: *mind* Can't speak? Don't know.

Mariana: Oh. *she stares at him a little longer, seeing how dead he looks inside. She can feel his sorrow and endless pain in him and does not feel any sign of positive emotion. Her pity overwhelms her* You look terrible, hun. I normally do not partake in human emotions, but I really wish to know. What made you like this?

Wyatt: (assuming all his speech will be mind) Abuse.

Mariana: Like verbal abuse? Sexual? Psychological?

Wyatt: Yes.

Mariana gasps a small bit.

Mariana: Oh dear. Who would do this to a poor boy like you?

Wyatt: everyone.

Mariana: How long has this been happening, dear?

Wyatt: since born.

Mariana: I see. Your life was treated as complete trash. Everyone hurts you and you    in your pain and sorrow. You remind me of myself. *she notices his red   tone* Do you have a   condition? You're all red.

Wyatt: born with it. Called freak for it.

Mariana: I think it looks cute on you.

Wyatt's heart feels something strange. Something other than pain, but it is only for a moment.

Wyatt: Really?

Mariana: Sure. People can't just target you because of the color of your  . It shouldn't matter what you look like. White, black, brown, red, yellow, blue, orange, green, purple, pink, the entire rainbow, it's all beautiful in my eyes. You are the way God designed you to be.

Wyatt has a very small blush on his face for the first time. He doesn't know what this feeling is, but he wants to have it more.

Mariana: I noticed you have a little   friendk with you. Mind if I take a look?

Wyatt hides it, looking defensive about it. He shakes his head.

Mariana: Is it private? I should have known. You can trust me, Wyatt. I won't make fun of you.

Wyatt hesitates for a while before handing it to her.

Wyatt: *mind* be careful reading. It's depressing.

Mariana looks at the   friendk. It is gold and purple and has a small bit of dried   on it. She reads the whole thing. It has all the injuries his parents caused him with every excruciating detail. It has so much depressing and horrifying stuff in it that no human could imagine. Mariana begins crying out of pure sorrow seeing what he had to go through. One of her tears turns into a tear shaped crystal that falls onto the ground. She calms herself.

Mariana: You are a broken child. I cannot believe a human could handle this. Your parents should be damned to hell for this. I don't want you to feel pain like this. I might hate humans, but this is just wrong. I want to give you something from the kindness of my heart.

Wyatt nods and gets his   friendk back. She takes the tear crystal on the ground and uses water to create a special necklace out of it. The water ties around the crystal like a string. She gently puts it on him.

Mariana: take my blessing. I will purge your emptiness and make you feel full. You will feel pain no longer. Bless your soul.

The necklace feels very tingly on him, like he is constantly being tickled with water, except he never feels wet. He feels the crystal and he can see water flowing inside of it like calm waves. He feels something. Happiness. He doesn't know what happiness is, but he really likes it. He looks up at Mariana and begins to break down into tears. He hugs her tentacle as he can only reach that far. She comes down and picks him up, hugging him with her entire body. He feels the intense warmth and cannot help but to smile for the first time of his life.

Mariana: You are a blessed child. *she puts him down* I will allow you to visit here whenever you want. We can talk about anything. I'll be here for you *points at the crystal* you should go now. It's getting dark.

Wyatt frowns a small bit, but listens to her and he walks back into the town, still feeling this strange surge of emotions he's never felt before.

*Meanwhile with Oliver and Tick*

Oliver enters Tick's room and Oliver lays down next to Tick* (He…)

Oliver: Hey there Tick! I'm back!

*Oliver hugs Tick and looks into his eyes with a wide smile* (HE IS?!?!)

Tick: *Sighs* Hi.

Oliver: Oh no! Are you sad again? Please just let the pain out.

Tick: I can't…

Oliver: Why not? You look sad… and I don't like sad ppl.

Tick: I don't want to talk about it.

Oliver: That's okay, Can I just talk to you about something that makes you happy then or do you want to just chill and relax?

Tick: Can I ask you something?

Oliver: Sure!

Tick: Are you… GAY?

Oliver: ……….

Tick: Are you?

Oliver: No. I'm not. I'm just platonic.

Tick: Oh. That explains why you act like you are "gay".

Oliver: I'm not gay at all. In fact, I like Gracie a little….

Tick: Oh.

Oliver: So what do you wanna do?

Tick: I'll just talk to you.

Oliver: Alright. What do you want to talk about?

Tick: Well I have some questions to start off the conversation.

Oliver: Okay, Ask away!

Tick: Why are you so much calmer than the others? Like you don't really seem to act like the other kids.

Oliver: I'm good kid.

Tick: Well you are welcome to my room anytime you like. But my second question is… Do you really care about me?

Oliver: Mhm! As a friend!

Tick: My last question is… What are your interests?

Oliver: I like nature, drawing digitally, being a kid and doing kid things. I also like being nice. I'll be honest, Those kids out there who claim to be compassionate don't even act like that. Like I don't force people to drink strawberry milk. I just hand the drink and if they want it, They can have it.

Tick: Oh. So you aren't like the others. Well I guess I can actually talk to you about personal stuff.

Oliver: Oh yeah! I'm very patient and I'm a good listener. You don't have to be afraid to talk to me or hide anything from me!

Tick: Well Ok… Well I guess I'll tell you why I was so sad… So basically I feel like I'm trapped. I'm always having to deal with  . Sophie's not the problem. It's the fact that everyday I have to wake up and just be constantly stressed out about everything and I can never get a break and I- AHHHHHH!!!!! *Covering my head and trying to rip out my hair*

Oliver: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? *Grabs Tick's hands and puts them away from his head* Hey, Listen to me Tick. listen to me and listen to me carefully. I can tell you have a lot of stress from some sort of situation. What I need you to do right now for me is just take a deep breath and relax for a minute. Can you do that?

Tick: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-

Oliver: WOAH WOAH WOAH! BREATHE!!!!!

Tick: I'VE DONE EVERY FORM OF STRESS TECHNIQUE. I CAN'T BE DE-STRESSED.

Oliver: *I turn off the lights and grab my phone and open "Headspace meditation"* Now, Close your eyes and take a deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep breath. *Stares right at Tick* I'm not going to stop staring until you do it.

Tick: *Sighs* Fine. I'll do it for you since you're the only one who's been nice. *Takes a deep breath*

Oliver: Now do that 10 times.

Tick: TEN?

Oliver: If you don't do it in a row, You have to start over!

Tick: *Does it 10 times. Is calm* Well, I definitely feel less stressed…

Oliver: *Turns the lights back on and stops the app* See? Now tell me, Are you feeling better?

Tick: Yeah. A little.

Oliver: A LITTLE?!?!? YOU need to feel COMPLETELY BETTER!

Tick: I think I'll survive more of the  -

Oliver: No. You aren't going to do anything until you feel better and are not feeling  d.

Tick: Please no more deep breathing.

Oliver: No need to do it. We are going to do some deep cleaning of the mind. Now what I want you to do is lay down flat on your back. Close your eyes and imagine you are in a happy place. Then feel as your legs and arms slowly relax and all that negativity is removed.

Tick: I guess I got nothing to lose. *Lays down flat and does the thing*

Oliver: Now just talk to me about yourself and how you feel.

*After that meditation*

Oliver: How do you feel?

Tick: Much better.

Oliver: We're going to do this each time you are stressed and each time you deal with any of that, I'm going to be with you to make sure you relax. Sound good?

Tick: Sure. But I'm getting tired so I'm going to sleep.

Oliver: Okay.

Meanwhile with Wyatt, He is strolling around for a place to stay, since he does not know how to get out of Oakland. He does not want to leave anyway. He finds the Wellington Theater and enters, curious about it. He finds Ash prepping for his show. He watches him while staying in a corner. Ash hears movement and sees him. He suddenly appears behind Wyatt with a big smile.

Ash: Heya kid. What brings you here?

Wyatt does not jump at this sudden appearance. He turns around and looks at Ash. He looks back to the stage.

Ash: Wanting a sneak peak o’ my show, eh? Well hate t’ break it t’ ya, but my shows are a mystery. But hey, ya look new here. I’m Ash Wellington, pleasure t’ meet ya. *Shakes hand*

Wyatt continues staring at the stage, still listening to him.

Ash: Hm, how about this. Since ya new here, how bout I give ya a free pass t’ my show?

Wyatt thinks about it and nods. Ash gives him a ticket.

Ash: The show will be next week, don't be late!

Wyatt is kindly kicked out of the theater. Wyatt continues his search for somewhere to stay, as it is getting very dark out. He comes across the lab and knocks on the door. Sophie answers and gasps at the new kid.

Sophie: Well hi there!!!

Wyatt stares at her. Sophie doesn't acknowledge that he can't talk.

Sophie: You look lost. Why don't you come on in and stay for the night? It's dark out.

Wyatt peaks inside and it looks super cool inside. It is unlike anything he has ever seen. He nods. She guides him through every room, and everything fascinates him somehow, even a couch surprises him. She takes him to Troy’s room. He gets really shy and backs off, thinking that this Troy person might hurt him.

Sophie: Hey, what’s wrong? Troy will not hurt you. Everything is ok.

Wyatt hesitates, but enters. Sophie sees YA trying to kiss Troy.

Sophie: YA! STOP KISSING TROY!!

Wyatt is confused.

Sophie: I’d like y'all to meet… What’s your name sweetie?

Wyatt is silent. He looks for how he can say something. He finds a paper and writes his name on it.

Sophie: Wyatt. This is Wyatt. He will be staying here for now. Say hi to him.

YA screams while Troy just waves.

Sophie takes him to Tick’s room, where Wyatt notices a sign that says “DO NOT ENTER!” Wyatt backs away from the door, listening to the sign. He has a small hint of fear in his eyes.

Sophie: That’s just Tick. He is a little grumpy, but he won’t hurt you.

She opens the door and sees Tick sleeping.

Sophie: Awwwwww he’s so cute when he is asleep.

Meanwhile in Aubrey, Texas…

There is someone on a duo/meet call talking about random stuff.

Aaron: He just really likes tie-dye.

Conner: IS HE??!?!?!?

Aaron: HES NOTTTT!!

Conner: I’m excited to visit tomorrow.

Aaron: Me too.

The next day…

Conner arrives at Aaron’s house.

Conner: Hey what’s up?

Aaron: Hey!

While their parents talk for like 2 hours, they are doing whatever shenanigans they do. They go outside and kick that one big tree in the front yard, only to realize the tree is gone. They go back in and try to recreate Aaron’s cringe videos when he was younger. Conner spends the night. In the morning, Aaron’s mom drags the both of them out to do something. They go to some sort of lake/park where they feed ducks. They eventually grow bored and notice something glowing in the forest.

Conner: Hey, what is that?

Aaron: I don't know, let's go find out.

While Aaron’s mom is completely distracted, they go into the forest to find the glowing thing. It starts floating away from them, leaving a trail. They chase it. It begins to get really dark and SCAWY. They turn around, but the lake is now gone and it is all forest. They are lost in a spooky forest.

Conner: Oh god. We are lost…

Aaron: I swear we didn't go that far.

They try and find their way out, it is super dark and they can barely see in front of them. Eventually, they see a light. They head towards it hopeful. Before they can get to it, they fall and crash into a lot of things and pass out. They both wake up a few minutes later. They get up. (So what I am trying to theorize is that the entrance to Oakland could literally be anywhere. The first step is using a light to lure people into a forest and put them into an infinite realm that exists in between where they are in reality and Oakland. Once they arrive, it will throw them from the forest into Oakland, but they cannot get hurt so they will be fine.

Conner: Ow… what happened? I'm not bleeding, am I? *scared*

Aaron: No, you’re fine. Wh-where are we?

Conner looks outwards. They are at the edge of the forest with a seemingly endless field. They see a city in the distance.

Conner: This looks like the backrooms.

Aaron: What if we are in Oakland?

*They both look at each other and laugh.*

Aaron: No, but really. It kind of makes sense, considering how the characters we made just appeared one day.

They are walking for a while. They are both visibly scared, Conner being the much more paranoid of the two, as he thinks this is all a dream and they will wake up soon.

Conner: If this is going to be like the pilot episode of Amazing Digital Circus, I am going to    myself.

Aaron: That city looks familiar.

Conner: I guess so, but where do I remember it from?

They enter the city and have the big realizaiton.

Aaron: …We are in oakland.

Conner: I'm sorry?

Aaron: WE ARE IN OAKLAND!!! OUR STORY… OUR CHARACTERS… ITS ALL REAL!

Conner: We are probably going insane or something. Are you sure we didn’t just pass out from eating an entire thing of wassabi from shaggy dogs?

Aaron: Nope, this is real.

Conner: Slap me then.

Aaron: You know I cant-

Conner: If its real, slap me.

Aaron does a weak little baby slap.

Conner: HARDER!

Aaron does a full slap on him and he feels it.

Conner: Ow… oh… OH NO! IT'S REAL! BUT HOW!?!

Aaron: That light thing must have guided us here.

Conner: So… does that mean… *Gasp* OUR CHARACTERS ARE REAL!!!! *Jumps with joy*

Aaron: SOPHIE IS REAL AND TICK?

Conner: RED IS REALLLL!!! BUT WAIT… that means I can find out if HE IS…

Aaron: Wait, isn't Sophie supposed to guide us when we first enter or something?

Conner: I dunno.

*Sophie appears like Caine*

Sophie: WELCOME TO OAKLAND! My name is Sophie and I'm going to give you the GRAND TOUR!

Aaron: Why does my own series remind me of the amazing digital circus?

Conner: Probably because we are insane.

Aaron: PLEASE DON'T SHOVE ME FULL OF STRAWBERRY MILK!!!!?!?!

Sophie: Hey, you remind me of YA and you remind me of YC! And by the way, don't worry! I'm not going to do that.

Conner: We remind you of them because IT IS US, JUST YOUNGER!! *impatient* LEMME SEE RED.

Sophie: Oh! Where did you guys come from??? And wait a second… How do you know Red?

Conner: CAUSE-

Aaron: Uh, this is gonna sound crazy, but we made you.

Sophie: *Laughs* I already knew that! We praise you! You are the creators of this world!

Conner: Yeah, that's great. But aren't you gonna figure out HOW YOUR CREATORS JUST FELL FROM WHEREVER WE WERE?!

Sophie: Oh! That… Sorry I kinda just put out guiding lights around different places for children to find it and uh. You just came here. Though you kinda are going to be stuck here forever. Well I could always just set y'all free but why would y'all want to do that? You're completely safe here.

Conner: *obviously knows this is a lie, since he remembers the stories* NUH UH!

Aaron: How did I manage to make you normal, Sophie?

Sophie: Idk, You made Gracie and stuff. I don't understand Oakland's logic either…

Aaron: Ok so Conner here wants to see Red. Could you please show him to Red?

Sophie: Oh, Sure! *Teleports Conner to Red's* Have fun!

Conner: *mimicking Gracie EEEEEEE!*

Sophie: So where do you wanna go, Aaron?

Aaron: I want to see OLIVER.

Sophie: Well what about Gracie?

Aaron: You know what, Yeah. I'll just go to her since she's kinda my favorite character for some reason.

Sophie: Wait, I'm not your favorite character?

Aaron: I kinda like Gracie tho.

Sophie: WAAAAAAAAA!!!!

Aaron: *Snickering* LOL. Gracie's not my favorite character, All my characters are kinda my favorite.

Sophie: Oh, Ok. Thank goodness! For a second there I thought I'd have to dress up as Gracie and-

Aaron: Wat.

Sophie: Well I'm kinda jealous of her…

Aaron: Oh.

Sophie: So um.. Want me to bring you to Gracie?

Aaron: Sure…

*Aaron is teleported to Gracie.*

Gracie: *Sees Aaron* EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! OH MY GOSH! IT'S YOU!

Aaron: What?

Gracie: I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!! YOU MADE ME AND THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD! *She locks the door and throws AYA out of the window and takes him to Sally. Sally is immediately obsessed and falls in love with AYA. Gracie then hugs Aaron and gives him a smoothie*

Aaron: Uh no thanks, I'm full-

*Gracie feeds him the smoothie and starts to hug him*

Gracie: I know everything about you! And also, I love you! You are so much better than that other creator.

Aaron: Uh. What are you doing?

Gracie: *feeds Aaron the smoothie* You are now going to be with me and I am going to be with you. I know you know that I am your favorite character… Spill the beans! Don't make me tickle it out of you!

Aaron: Ok. I like Oliver more than you.

Gracie: WHAT???? NO YOU DON'T! You like me!!!

Aaron: Yeah, I do.

Gracie: I KNEW IT! EEEE! So, I want to know more about you. Everything about you!

Aaron: *flexing as if I actually own a business* Well I'm a entrepreneur and I like to do a lot of research and code stuff.

Gracie: THAT'S SO GREAT! EEEEE! Can I ask you something though?

Aaron: Anything.

Gracie: How'd you get here?

Aaron: Uhh. Well that is kinda a long story but-

Gracie: I want to hear all of it!

Aaron: Well me and Conner were just doing our average staff and then we see this light, We followed it and entered Oakland.

Gracie: Ooo!

Aaron: Yeah.

Gracie: So wanna know a little more about me?

Aaron: Sure.

Gracie: Well, My favorite holiday is Christmas, I love to obsess over boys, I love to draw, paint and I love to hike. I love to hear stories and I want to be a writer just like you!

Aaron: Oh. Well anything can be done if you work hard.

Gracie: REALLY??? EEEEE! *Hugging tightly* I DON'T EVER WANT YOU TO LEAVE! IF YOU LEAVE, I'M GOING TO CRY!

Aaron: Hmm. How about I create a clone of me for you so whenever you want to see me or obsess over boys or me, You can still have me!

Gracie: AMAZING!

Aaron: I'll make it so he's like everyone else. If you could just let me go, I can do it!

Gracie: Ok! *Lets go*

Aaron: RUUUUUN! *Runs out the house.*

Gracie: COOOME BACK! *Chases after and is trying to tackle*

*Aaron sees Sophie and she's waiting for him to enter the lab*

*Aaron enters and Sophie slams the door shut before Gracie can enter causing Gracie to bump into the door and fall down. Gracie is now pounding on the door*

Sophie: You'll be safe here. Gracie will eventually go away.

Aaron: No, She won't. To stop Gracie, She needs a boy like one of the Oakland boys to stop her from obsessing. If you can find someone like YA that Gracie will find more attractive than me, She will leave me alone. But where would I find someone like that?

*Oliver exits Tick's room and comes downstairs to see me and meet me*

Oliver: Hello!

Aaron sees Oliver.

Aaron: Sophie, This is gonna sound crazy but I may need to make it so Oliver and Gracie are together…

Sophie: Well that'd just be weird!

Aaron: Then I need to change Gracie's age to 15.

Sophie: Are you sure?

Aaron:Yes. *Changes her age to 15* now this won't be weird. Oliver, Do you want to be with Gracie?

Oliver: Yeah, I've kinda liked her anyways…

*Sophie teleports Oliver in front of Gracie and Gracie squeals with joy (EEEE). Gracie then takes Oliver to her house and now Oliver and Gracie are a thing.*

Sophie: So what about Tick?

Aaron: He needs a girlfriend. Clearly Sally wasn't good. Tick is gonna need someone who can help him mentally. And Gracie is a horrible option.

Sophie: Hmm. Maybe he doesn't need a person. Maybe he needs something else.

Aaron: What do you mean?

Sophie: Well I've been working on this prototype magic device thing that is supposed to essentially love a human and take care of a human? I created it as a magic machine doohickey to help other people with loneliness. Tick is basically going to be dating an AI.

Aaron: That would probably work for him since he's always hating people and stuff. So how will this AI work?

Sophie: Lemme show you!

*Sophie takes Aaron to the inventing room and she takes the curtains off the AI invention.*

Aaron: What is this?

Sophie: Introducing "STELLA AI"! She's the latest and greatest AI-Magic technology.

Aaron: So what exactly is this?

Sophie: So basically as you can see, There is a bed, Right? Well this is a magic bed. You'll also notice a headset, Haptic suit and an oxygen mask along with a  . (Classic Sophie AI inventing to always add a   to everything). Now you don't see it now as it will come out of the bed. Also there are over a million things that can come out of this bed. Basically STELLA AI is an AI that can be Tick's "date" since he hates people. Also Tick will feel more relaxed because this AI has a built in "HeadSpace app".

Aaron: Classic Sophie to always add  s to everything.

Sophie: You know it! Another neat feature is that this AI comes complete with a girl voice that can do the Gracie EEEEE. And it can even chat with you and is built to act like a girlfriend for Tick since it was originally just going to be a bed to help people sleep better but since Tick has been having some stuff happen, I changed it up to be for Tick! It's designed for him and only him! Also it is waterproof, fireproof and with weird Oakland logic, It's just immune. We'll have to see how this goes with Tick.

Aaron: I see. I guess we will have to see. So how are you going to put it in his room when he doesn't notice?

Sophie: Maybe you can try to distract him?

Aaron: Ok.

*Aaron enters Tick's room*

Tick: GRRRRRR- *notices a different Aaron* Huh? Oh great, Another Aaron.

Aaron: Woah, Chill. I'm the original Aaron.

Tick: That's what they all say… I don't believe you.

Aaron: Oh really? Well what if I could prove it?

Tick: Yeah, I'd like to see some proof.

*Aaron writes down "Tick is now in the happy room and is being hugged and   hugd by YA and is loving it"*

*Aaron runs over into the happy room and sees Tick surprised and screaming*

Tick: I BELIEVE YOU. PLEASE STOP THIS.

*He does*

Tick: Thank you. So, What are you doing here in Oakland if you are the original?

Aaron: It's a long story…

Tick: Oh, Ok. So uh, What do you like to do and please tell me it's something normal!

*Sophie sneaks into Tick's room and replaces his old bed with the STELLA AI bed and she throws the old bed in the squid pool. She then closes Tick's door and goes to the squid pool and grabs the bed and sells it to Romone for some reason.*

*After talking, Tick goes to his room. We'll see what happens later.*

*Aaron goes to find Conner*

*Meanwhile with Conner and Red*

Red: What the…

Conner: Red! It is so great to finally see you in real life!!!!

Red: Do I know you?

Conner: probably not. You do know a bite sized version of me though.

Red: YC?

Conner: Yep. I'm him, but older.

Red: Oh wait, you're PC. (Present Conner)

Conner: Well… not really. I'm like… as original as you can get.

Red: I don't follow.

Conner: I am the first Conner. The one and only. The official. The cream of the crop. The messiah. I am… that guy.

Red: So what I understand is that… you are Conner? The original?

Conner: yes. I am your creator.

Red: hm.. prove it.

Conner writes something. "Red has a dress and loves Maya"

Red: Wait, where did this dress come from, and why do I have emotions for Maya? What are you doing?

Conner: I can change the course of this entire history… I am literally God! Or uh… Co God.

Red: I mean, you did prove it. I'll believe you I guess. Do you think you could give me the ability to drink?

Conner: Sure. *writes, "Red is immune to liquid in his system and can process and taste it like a human."*

Conner: Ok.

Cleetus: wow. I am intellectual. I am now convinced you are very intelligent sir. *time runs out* wells imsa let's yous have free foods for lifums!

Conner: thanks! I'm gonna see what Mike is up to!

*He goes to see what Mike is up to*

*meanwhile with Tick*

*Tick enters his room and he closes the door. Tick looks around his room as he is suspicious something is not right but everything seems all in order*

Tick lays on his bed. Suddenly the magic bed lights green indicating it's on and STELLA AI turns on. Tick is laying down on his side, depressed again as he always is. STELLA AI notices this and immediately emits a lavender smelling liquid that puts Tick to sleep.

*Tick starts to dream but STELLA is doing something as he's sleeping… what could it be?*

*Tick sleeps for about 8 hours and then wakes up. As soon as he wakes up, He notices a headset is on him and it can't be removed…

What is happening?

*Tick is wearing a headset where STELLA can see him, There is a haptic suit around his body and under his suit he has no clothes on except underwear. Another thing is that Tick is wearing a oxygen mask and   and in his ears are comfy headphones that cannot come off.. STELLA also has a heartbeat monitor strapped to his chest along with some things on his legs that help heal him and make sure he is ok. They also check his vitals. When Tick's eyes are open, He immediately sees on the headset all of his vitals and everything about him in the headset. He can see everything about him. Suddenly two eyes appear on the headset screen.  This headset is optimized for eyes and cannot   hug the eyes in any way. Suddenly Tick hears a 14 year old girl voice (that sounds like Gracie or the EEEEE UwU type person. The YA type voice but girl.) calling his name. Tick starts to panic as he doesn't understand what's going on and he doesn't know where he is. As you know, Haptic suits can make people feel things. Well Tick can also be fed things and feel them. Basically the AI is controlling him but is trying to keep him calm. So yeah, An AI girlfriend! This is like some futuristic 2075 stuff right here ngl.*

STELLA: Good morning, How'd you sleep?

Tick: WHAT… IS THIS? WHO… WHAT… WHERE AM I?

STELLA: No need for panic! Why don't you tell me about yourself? I'll start with telling you a bit about myself. The name's Stella. I am an interesting person. Before you ask any questions, Tell me about yourself! How are you doing?

Tick: You better not be another one of Sophie's inventions… I THOUGHT SHE WAS NORMAL.

STELLA: Hey, Please relax. She is normal.

Tick: WELL WHERE AM I? WHY CAN'T I MOVE? WHAT'S EVEN HAPPENING-

STELLA: Hey hey hey! Please relax, Friend. All questions will answered later. First, Please relax and calm yourself. Tell me about yourself!

Tick: Fine. Well my name is Tick. I kinda just don't do much. I mostly sit around and mope.

STELLA: I see, It's great to meet you, Tick.

Tick: Now answer my question. WHERE THE HECK AM I, WHY CAN'T I MOVE AND WHAT AM I WEARING?

STELLA: Well, You are on a magic comfortable bed and you are in a Haptic suit that is also taking note of your body health and monitoring and taking care of it, There is a heartbeat monitor on your chest that is keeping your heart not only healthy but monitoring you, You are wearing a headset that you cannot take off, You are wearing magic headphones you can't take off that I am speaking to you in, You have a oxygen mask in your nose allowing me to help you breathe, You also have a   that feeds you food whenever you need it. I also have hundreds of magic machines and doohickeys connected to you that is keeping you alive. All of these wiring boxes are underneath the bed and you have a big gigantic protective shield that is containing your body in so you are being healed and taken care of by me. And you can't move because you cannot hurt yourself. Magic will also be nourishing, nurturing and healing your body and making sure you don't get atrophy or anything that can cause health problems. Now, I am an AI named Stella. But please do not be mad! I heard how you don't talk to people and you hate them. So I will talk to you! But I'm not just a machine, I'm also 80% magic! Any more questions you have?

Tick: Yes… Why does your voice sound familiar?

STELLA: Oh, Well my voice is mostly taken from all the Oakland kids voices merged into one voice that sounds like a 14 year old girl so my voice may sound familiar but I'm not an AI you know. I don't like to be called AI though, I prefer to be known as a person. Since I am 80% magic, I'm not fully AI. I'm kinda mostly 30% machine.

Tick: Ok. Well what if I need to pee?

STELLA: Magic will take care of that. Your pee will automatically be removed from your body when you need to pee and it will be disposed by magic properly. You don't have to worry about eating or drinking as you will constantly be fed and hydrated. Now, If there are no more questions, Let me explain how this will work.

Tick: Ok.

STELLA: You will be taken care of at all times. I will basically be your virtual friend. Now because you are always lonely, I'm going to be your virtual friend that is a girl.. I will make sure you are happy. But you must be kind and honest. If you aren't, I will guide you. You will not be treated like a child if you don't want to. But you will be treated like a human. That's pretty much it. Now I'll be very kind to you and you do the same!

Tick: Ok. So uh. I see my current body health on here. Is this all I'll see besides your eyes looking directly at me?

STELLA: Nope! You will see many things in a magic world.

Tick: Ok.

*The scene changes in the headset to a coffee shop and STELLA looks like a human and is looking at Tick with a smile*

*Meanwhile with Conner*

*He goes to Mike*

Conner: Uh, Hello? *Is in the house*

Mike: Hyello there. My name Mike. You remind me of basement child.

Conner: Well uh this is gonna sound crazy but I'm your creator…

Mike: Prove it.

*he does the thing*

Mike: Ok.

*Meanwhile, In a town located in Oregon.*

Soos: Man, The mystery shack sure is busy today! I just wish Dipper and Mabel were here.

Wendy: Ah cheer up Soos, It's almost summer and I'm sure they will come!

*Surely enough, They do.*

Dipper: Hey guys! We told you we'd be back here next summer!

Soos: What's up dudes?

Mabel: Eh, Nothing much!

Dipper: Actually, We are going to stay here for the rest of the summer again! So we'll go on more adventures!

Soos: YES! I've been dreaming of this day to happen again.

Dipper: So uh. Where's Grunkle stan?

Soos: I dunno, He's not back from traveling around the world yet.

Dipper: Man, That sucks.

Soos: Well why don't we go on an adventure today?

Dipper: Sure!

*They enter a forest and notice a note on the ground about summoning an axolotl (Bill Cipher will be revived this way)*

*They chant the axolotl thing and Bill Cipher appears*

Bill Cipher: FINALLY, I'M FREE!

Mabel: NO! IT'S BILL CIPHER!

Bill: Relax, I'm not here to take over Gravity falls. I'm here for a different town called Oakland. I heard it is more powerful than Gravity falls and if you kids help me, I won't take over this universe anymore. I'll only take over Oakland.

Dipper: Wait, What's the catch?

Bill: No catch. You've earned my respect.

Dipper: I wasn't expecting Bill to be so… friendly?

Bill Cipher: I've given up my ruling of the world thing and I'm just gonna take over Oakland cause I can.

Dipper: Oh. So uh. You want us to try to make a portal or something?

Bill: Yeah… Could you please help me?

Mabel: Hmm, What's in it for us?

Bill: I'll give you both two wishes?

Dipper: And swear to only take over Oakland?

Bill: Yes. I've kinda been bored trying to take over Gravity falls when OAKLAND HAS ALWAYS BEEN BETTER THAN THE WORLD!

Dipper: Well shall we get started?

Bill: Yes…

Dipper: Ok! Let's get building? Soos, Coming along?

Soos: Oh yeah dudes, I'm always up for an adventure!

Meanwhile in Oakland… Cinner had finished meeting everyone he was wanting to meet. He meets back up with Aaron.

Conner: Hey I'm back.

Aaron: This was super fun.

Conner: *feeling something suspicious*  What did you do?

Aaron: What do you mean?

Conner: hmm I have that feeling again. Sophie did something.

Aaron: Oh that. We just gave Tick a virtual friend!

Conner suddenly realizes what he is going to witness. He rushes into ticks room and witness it.

Conner: OH MY GOODNESS, SOPHIE!!!

Sophie comes in, guiding Wyatt with her since he was lost.

Sophie: Oh, Hello Conner.

I see Wyatt and wave at him happily. He waves back shyly.

Conner: Can you uh, perhaps explain this?

Sophie: It’s my latest AI that will help Tick.

Conner: This is like… your 100th nurturing AI. cant you use one of those?

Sophie: They don't work anymore.

Conner: Where do your trashed AI go anyway?

He turns off the AI, making Tick wake up.

Tick: HEY!

Conner: Sophie might have trapped you in another nurturing simulator again.

Tick: I WANNA GO BACK!!!

Conner: Wait… you actually liked it?

Tick: YES!

Conner: Well shit. I need a second. *I leave the lab angrily.*

Tick: NOW I CAN'T EVER FEEL TRUE LOVE AGAIN! *Crying* AND IT'S ALL HIS FAAAAULLLLLLLLLT!!!! GRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!

*Tick leaves the lab angrily too and chases after Conner angrily*

Tick: HEY! DON'T YOU DARE RUN AWAY!

Conner: You know you can just turn it back on. Go live with your love of your life or something, it's not like they are real anyway. You'll just return to your squidward like miserable self in a few episodes. This place is hell. I wanna go home. *breaking down* Now I understand why YA is the way he is… he was the first to realize the true meaning of this place… a purgatory for broken children.

Tick: GRRRRRRRRRR. I WILL GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM!

Conner: And how do you suppose you will do that?

Tick: Oh, Sophie can just teleport you outta here in like a second. You really think you are stuck here?

Conner: why didn't you just say that? I'm not being stuck here.

Tick: Well I don't really have anywhere else to go besides Portugal. WHICH BANNED ME BY THE WAY! I can't leave.

Conner: L+ratio buddy, but why did they ban you?

Tick: Because apparently I was "driving without a license" and I kinda got high on stuff.

Conner: Ah, a classic underage DUI. Too bad I'll never experience that, since I still can't drive. Wait… now that I think about it, Aaron never wrote that you got banned. Hm…

Tick: I make my own decisions and I STOLE THE NOTE  friendK! Actually I made a copy of it…


Conner: Oh.

Tick: Now I can do whatever I want! Well- not really as according to the weird logic in this world, I can't really modify people so all I can do is kinda make things! AARON WROTE THAT JUST NOW SO I CAN'T TAMPER WITH THE WORLD!!!! WAA!

Conner: Well nobody will really trust you with a journal. Who knows what you'd do.

Tick: All I do all day is lay around in my room and mope around all day talking about my horrible life. Why would I care about modifying this world? I mean, If I was a God, I'd be a lazy one. Like I would be super chill. It says here in this note  friendk that I used to be "normal" but how is trying to    everyone, using Sophie as a slide and getting angry all the time "normal"? I question my existence and purpose here. If I'm your character, Then-

Conner: Well uh… the slide thing was kinda Aaron’s idea. I am not really in control here. He’s the one you should be GRRRing at.

Tick: Oh. Ok then. So uh where is he?

Conner: In the lab. You wanted to be reconnected with your AI wife, right?

Tick: Yeah. I HATE people.

Conner: I know.

*Tick is reconnected to his AI STELLA but before he does that, He has a talk with Aaron. Conner gets some popcorn and a Fanta to watch it*

Tick: GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!

Aaron: Um. Hello!

Tick: YOU.

Aaron: Me?

Tick: YOU MADE ME THIS WAY YOU CREATURE!

Aaron: What did I do? Hm?

Tick: YOU MADE ME DEPRESSED AND INSANE! I KNOW WHO YOU ARE! NOW I WANT TO FIGHT YOU.. WHOEVER WINS WILL BE FORCED TO NEVER RETURN TO OAKLAND. THE WINNER STAYS IN OAKLAND FOREVER….

Aaron: Wait WHAT?

Tick: ARE YOU SCARED YOU'RE GONNA LOOSE?

Aaron: Naw. I got the note  friendk so I'm good.

*Tick takes the note  friendk*

Tick: NUH UH! *Poofs it on the top of a very tall shelf*

Aaron: OH NO! NOW I'M WEAK!

Tick: So, ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT OR WHAT?

*Sophie notices Tick and grabs a needle. She injects him with it and he falls asleep*

Conner: Aw man, it was about to get interesting. *Packs up chair like squidward*

Sophie: You should be fine now. Tick is very very unstable as you can tell.

Aaron: Are you forgetting I made him?

Sophie: Oh yeah, Sorry I uh- nevermind. Anyways, I'll just teleport you guys home and you'll be good to go!

*Sophie grabs her portal gun and makes a portal back home*

Sophie: Y'all want some Strawberry milk for the road? Or maybe some sodas?

Conner: NOPE *Ran into the portal* (I would not really do well in Oakland)

*Aaron takes some root beer and enters the portal*

*They go back to Tara who is still distracted*

To be continued…

Red: welp here goes… so basically, he was once a human named Adam. He was born in an average family. Adam was an average kid, that no one understood. Mom and dad always gave him demands. (Enough of the reference) he had a lot of musical talent and won the elementary and middle school talent show. He was also good at building and engineering. Sometimes, he would try to combine random household items and somehow make a movable animatronic. He was able to build a working animatronic he called monk monk, which was soon abandoned and sold to a shopping center for someone in particular to buy those certain items and recreate him. Later in highschool, he was in a chucky cheese and gained inspiration to make his own pizzeria. So using the money his dad gave him since he was a rich guy, he would plan out the creation of his own pizzeria. He wanted to build his own animatronics, but was unfamiliar with all the new tech. So with the help of a young Sophie, fresh out of magic school, they built a few animatronics, one of which was a prototype robot he called red. He remembers that last showbiz that was open and created the design based off of it. Me made it a red bear since his favorite color was red. He even called it red. He wanted to hire Sophie on the team, but she had to go back to magic school for a masters degree in magic arts. Red started to hire people, starting with his childhood friend, Jose. He played his role as the detective panther called Pyro. He hired some more people to take the roles of Ray the blue Jay, Snowy the tiger, Roxy the fox, and Gorri the gorilla (based off fatz geronimo the gorilla) which never got introduced due to constant robotic malfunctions. Snowy was Sarah, Adam's girlfriend in school, Ray was Jeremy, a s  ed guitarist that was interested in the job. Roxy was some girl in his school that was obsessed with him and begged for the job. Later, he hired cooks, a Janitor, marketers, usual job stuff, and a manager who was once his teacher for business class. His name is Jerry (He is important). He was a bit sick at the time with a very bad disease, but he didn't care. He was also schizophrenic, and it kinda drove him mad. They were a super popular band that even surpassed chuck e cheese in popularity. He made his own animatronic called springlock. Then one day, Jerry didn't take his schizophrenic meds and lost his mind. He thought everyone he saw was fake, so he put on his suit. After one of their shows, Ray comes in with the suit on and Jerry breaks his neck while he is in the suit. Pyro came in later and found Ray dead, he tried to help him when Jerry stabbed him in his head, making the spring locks activate from the  ,   ing him brutally. Snowy and Roxy join the scene, trying to fight him, but it is no use, as he stabs Roxy multiple times in the chest. The suit isn't able to resist them since most of the suit is what usual costumes would be like, with the exception of a human endo. Red comes in and saves Snowy. He fights Jerry, and Jerry trips over a water bucket and gets water all over the room. Red, Jerry and Snowy all get spring locked. Adam's final words in the suit was, "I love you…" (Adam loved the girl in the Snowy suit in high school). The place is now abandoned. 4 years later, a strange creature made of candy finds the abandoned pizzeria and sees Red and the GANG. With his magic, he is able to fix Red, Snowy, and Pyro, but not the others. Red wakes up and tries to attack him, but Romone calms him by talking in general, as Red does not recognize this voice. His soul possessed the suit so that he can function despite being dead in a suit. Romone shows him his palace and Red is very confused. Red wonders where everyone is. Jerry's animatronic suit is missing. Red wants to    him once and for all. Red begins to go on these forced adventures that romone dragged him along for. They soon became best friends. Everything was fine, until suddenly a few people moved in. At this point, red was once again abandoned and Romone couldn't fix him and was depressed and lost his once insane energy. Sophie sees Red and recognizes the suit. Cleetus somehow fixes him and they become friends.  Sophie was able to upgrade him into a super robot capable of almost everything. We know what happens after all of this.

Romone: Romone was born in planet X. He was the favorite romonian. (In Romone's planet, They believe in a religion similar to Buddhism.) Romone had many friends and was praised by everyone. One day however, Romone became the king. His mother taught him how to make cake and he was taught candy magic. He was always great at school and he excelled top of the class. But Romoney baloney edited his test and made Romone fail so Romone ended up being grounded for a while but then valdor found out RB made him fail so Romone is elected king and is now ruler of the planet x. That's when they crash into Oakland and when Romone meets Red.

Romone's mother: uhh. Her origin is unknown.

Mike: This is even more complicated. Let's start around 72 years ago in Moscow, Russia. His grandparents were in high school when they met. They were your average 1950's couple. They did normal stuff you would do in that time, when the grandpa got a knock on the door. There were some guys in robes who asked for him and his wife to come with them. They didn't really question it and went in the car. They were driven to a suspicious forest where they asked them to join this cult thingy. They didn't wanna but they threatened to    the grandmother, who was pregnant at the time. They were forced to join and had to hunt a bear and sacrifice it to this really big hole they made where they would worship evil. They were welcomed in kinda. Later, the grandma gave birth to a girl named Mariya, who will later become Mike's mother. After she had the child, they wanted to leave the cult, but they didn't let them. They instead told them to sacrifice the child in the name of evil. They tricked them by throwing a sandbag in a blanket into the hole. Somehow, this made some sort of ancient evil be summoned. They all bowed down to the evil and the evil told the grandparents that they will be cursed for this trick they did. It's an ancient family curse that will be passed down for generations. They were so scared, they escaped to America. This was during the cold war, so at first, they weren't allowed in. But they had a connection with an American war general that helped their father, who was a war veteran and the general's best friend. They reluctantly let them in, keeping a close eye on them. They loved America, until their grandparents  d a brutal   by somehow being flung off a bridge from a car crash. Out of insane luck, only Mariya survived. Mariya later got adopted by an abusive family. She was sexually and physically abused. She would escape to her best friend James' home. (this will be Mike's father later). They soon fell in love in college, but didn't have kids until 1999. There was a boy named Nish who was super shy and paranoid. They didn't know what was wrong with him. He would talk to people who don't exist and would scream at the wall like he sees things. He was then diagnosed with a heavy hallucination schizophrenia. One day, James found this strange club thingy that he saw from old tapes his grandparents had. He saw it had expanded to America and he went to see it. The cult let him in, but only if he sacrificed his child to the hole in the name of evil. He didn't want to do this, so he tied Nish's legs to a rock, and   ed him in a lake so that he didn't have to do it. The cult found out about this but liked that he still   ed the child, so they let him in. James, now being part of the family curse, went bonkers. He abused his wife a lot, even while she was pregnant. On the two year anniversary of Nish's  , Mike was born. James didn't know what to do with him, so he locked him in a basement when he was 3. His mother took a week to find him because she was super sick. She divorced James and left him. James begged her to stay, but she wasn't having it. In 2012, she meets a man in a bar (its James) and falls in love with him, soon realizing its James. She didn't know how to react. She finally decided to get back together only if he doesn't abuse their family. James promised he was a changed man (he's a liar.) Two years later, Nasha was born. She was definitely a troubled child like Nish, and James didn't like that, but wanted to keep his marriage. Soon, Mike discovers tapes of the cult that his grandparents and James are involved in. Mike showed his mom and they drove off to spy on them. They witnessed a ton of people  , and they were spotted. They luckily escaped. James found out about the tapes and brutally beat Mike and forced him to keep quiet. Nasha saw all of that and felt super bad. The generational curse began to affect him as his girlfriend broke up with him, he was beaten, he failed almost everything and he was unpopular. He was going to take his own life, when his sister Nasha somehow calmed him. Mike devoted his life to protecting his sister and mom, but his mom was supposedly   ed by James. (She isn't dead) he had enough and beat up the dad and sent him to the hospital in a coma. He continued living with his sister until he was somehow invited to a party. He took his sister to make sure she doesn't get scared alone. Nasha wanders off and sees something beyond evil, it's the evil thing from the hole. She ran away from it and was super scared, when Mike saved her. He sacrificed himself for her and was brutally   ed, his entire face and arm burnt and his whole body removed of  . His jaw was extended from ear to ear. Nasha was super depressed. For some reason, Mike's soul did not want to leave and he came back to life as a half dead half alive person. He put on a raggedy cloak and a mask to hide his face. He went to find Nasha and found her. She was super scared of him until she realized it was him. She was super traumatized by being alone and is constantly attached to him. He later found Oakland while trying to find the hole demon. He discovered that he had also been possessed by an eldritch demon that only takes form when the mask comes off.

Nasha: She is the youngest of the three siblings in Mike’s family. She was a very skittish and shy child, just like her oldest brother Nish, who was dead at that time. She had heavy depression, even for a young girl. She was very attached to her brother Mike, and always tried to help him in times of need. One day, she was asleep on Mike, when she heard a tape playing. She watched the tape silently as Mike watched it, not knowing his sister was awake. The tape traumatized her and Mike found out she was awake. He promised that he would keep her safe at all costs. She had to witness many brutal beatings their father gave Mike, and always ran in as soon as possible. When their mother “ d”, Mike took care of her alone in the house since their father was in a coma due to Mike getting angry and beating him up. She was taken to a party one night and saw a white stray cat running in the forest. She loved cats, so she chased it as a first reaction. Right as she got to the cat, the cat was eaten by the hole demon (In Mike’s origin). She got scared and ran away, but she was so small she could not run fast. Her brother found her and told her to run. She did, crying the whole way. Later, she went back to find her brother, but found his mangled and burnt   . She was depressed. A figure approached her and also cried seeing Mike. It was revealed that it was her mother, alive and well. She apologized for making them think she was dead, as she was just trying to hide from their insane father and forgot about them. They gave Mike a proper burial and her mom left once again. When the family curse began, she was not very affected by it. She only felt cold inside and out. She saw a masked man approaching her. She was terrified, until she realized it was her brother Mike, back from the dead somehow. They were both very glad to see each other. She was completely unaware about this curse and what had happened to her. Her   turned a very pale blue and she felt super cold constantly. Mike kept her safe at all times though. She figured out she could control all forms of weather based on her emotions, so she would try to stay happy for Mike’s sake and so that most days would be sunny. If her emotions get too unstable, she will revert to her eldritch demon/angel form. Strangely enough, her eldritch form is more angelic than demonic. (The curse is demonic when the person was dead when it happened, and is angelic to living family members) she takes shape as a giant white cat with hundreds of eyes and six legs. It looks similar to the cat she chased in the forest. They later find Oakland and stuff.

Mariya: The mother of Mike’s family. She was born in Russia. Her mother was forced to sacrifice her, but threw a sandbag into the sacrifice hole instead. This is where the curse began. She had no idea about any of this. They left for America a few years later. She had a best friend named James. He was the only American who understood her and was nice despite the cold war. Her grandparents  d in a tragic car accident and were flung off a bridge. She was at the house with a babysitter when she heard the news. She was sent to an adoption center where she would be adopted later. Her adoptive parents did not like her, so it was strange to her why they would even bother adopting her in the first place. They had physically and sexually   huged her in lots of ways, even her adoptive brother took part in it. She ran away to James’ home and their parents were nice enough to let her stay. They later fell in love and got married. That was until James found the cult. He abused her a lot. She gave birth to Nish, who would   years later from an “accident.” She would have Mike two years later, and had to see James abuse him as well. She divorced him and left with Mike to live a better life. She was a mother you could only have in your dreams. One day, she was drunk in a bar when she met a man. It took her a few days of dating this man to realize it was James. He had told her he was a changed man and would never   hug her or their child again. She hesitated, but remarried him. They had Nasha later. They had seen what their father did and were horrified. She heard from Nasha about Mike’s brutal beatings. She was so full of anger and fear that she left, forgetting about the kids. They both thought the father   ed her and that is what led Mike to put James in a coma. She wanted to go back and get her children, but was scared that James or the cult were after her. It took a while for her to locate them. She ran into a forest where she found Nasha crying over Mike’s   . She was heartbroken. She gave him a proper burial and made an unbreakable promise with Nasha that she will return soon and can live happily ever after. That was, until the curse took place. She did not change at all, except the fact that she had a strange glow wherever she went. (She had an eldritch angel since she is not dead) She is able to control night and day at will and all forms of light and energy. Her eldritch angel form can be summoned at will and might be the most powerful, taking the form of Seraphim, a biblically accurate angel. She will find her children some day.

Nish: The oldest son in Mike's family. Had a very extreme case of schizophrenia. Saw things that didn't exist, was afraid of things that weren't there, the usual symptoms. He made friends with people that weren't actually there. His father still tried to care for him. His mother loved him with all her heart even with this disorder. He was shy and jumpy, as he didn't know what was real or what was not. The only person he knew was real were his parents. One day, his father asked if he wanted to go on a "fishing trip" with him. He agreed and went with him. He noticed a big rock on the back seat and asked about it. His dad said it would be like an anchor for the boat they would be on. He didn't know much about boats, so he trusted him. They rode a boat to the middle of the lake. His father asked him if he could turn around. He did. He noticed someone in the water, they looked like they were   ing (this was an illusion). He tried to tell his dad, but he told him he was seeing things. He felt something being tied around his feet, like a rope. He tried to snap out of it, thinking it was just an illusion, but it was actually real. His dad had tied his legs to a rock. His dad then acted like he saw the   ing person and told him to get in there and save him. He jumps in, only to be pulled underwater by the rock tied to him. It took him 5 minutes to fully   . A few years later, when the curse had begun, he was suddenly revived. He now has a fish-like body and could travel through any body of water or reflection like portals. He is now searching for his father to get revenge. Little does he know he will soon find Oakland, just not yet. The rock that   ed him is tethered onto his back and should not be removed at all costs. Him and his entire family are possessed by eldritch demons, and the rock is the one thing keeping it from waking up. Without it, he turns into a leviathan like creature.

James: Mike's father and stuff. Everything shown above in Mike's origin. He is still in the coma from when Mike beat him, or is he? He may or may not have the powers of both an eldritch demon and angel. It is unknown, really.

Sophie: She was always a good kid but became insane after some sort of event. She went to Oakland and that's all. But she got her powers from magic school. She also had to deal with Troy being abused.

Troy:

YA:

Ash (Sociopath): He was born in Dublin, Ireland. He was a kid fascinated with theater after going to a circus show with his mom. He put all his stuffed animals on the floor and did magic tricks to them as if they were the au nce. All was happy, but as you know with all my origins, it gets dark quickly. His mother had a super bad illness that was incurable in his time. He tried to help her, since his dad was too busy running for prime minister. His mother  d a few years later. This caused him to go in a downward spiral of pain. He got bullied at school a lot and that ended up being his breaking point, leading him to lash out on his bullies, nearly   ing him. He liked the thought of having power over people and enjoyed causing pain. He set up mini “Shows” that people would go to so he could   them through cruel games. He   ed his father when he was getting kicked out for causing chaos. He fled to america to start a new life as a corrupt show host. He built his theater and continued ruining and   ing the lives of thousands of people from his insane shows. That is when he heard of Oakland, “The happiest town on earth” and decided to try and make it the unhappiest. He went there and built the theater and tried to   everyone in Oakland, but they did not budge. That is when the story stuff happens and the timeline changes.

Ash (Other): In this alternate timeline, most of his childhood was the same except his mother was alive. After his mother was suddenly cured of that illness, his life carried like normal. He started to do his game show thing and was super popular in his country. He soon was known worldwide and became super famous. That is basically the only difference.

Gracie: born in Potnuk but had usually a good childhood. Nothing really happened to her. She's just stupid and obsessed with guys for some reason.

Malcey:

YC: I did stupid stuffs.

Snowie:

Cam:

Kam:

Mariana: King Neptune had many children, one of which was a forgotten one, who was Mariana. She was a cross between a human and a sea monster octopus, as his wife cheated on him with a half man half sea monster octopus. He banished her into the depths of the sea never to return to the shallow part. She was guided by her brother Triton to be able to have the necessary things to survive in the depths of the ocean such as light. She soon became the queen of the Mariana Trench, where her name originated since she named it after herself. Her kingdom was very powerful and she planned on overthrowing Neptune, until Neptune sent down Triton to    her. She was angry at his betrayal and fought back. However, he was able to use a special weapon to petrify her and he left her in the depths of the trench. Thousands of years later, A magic merman freed her from petrification. As per usual, she fell in love with him. They were a very happy couple, until she had gotten pregnant. He suddenly had to leave for a "Quest" and never came back. She was heart broken. The only issue was, she didn't know how this would work since she was half human half sea monster. She noticed her stomach grew like a human would. She thought it would last for 9 months and was quite relieved. 4 years had passed. (She grew thousands of octopus eggs in her like an octopus). She was finally able to get them out, only to notice they were all dead. She saw one was moving and held it in her arms happily, but it wasn't too long before it  d as well. In her own grief, she cried so hard that it caused many earthquakes on the earth's surface. Her grief later turned into a hatred for humans, since the merman was part human. The only humans she ever spared were children or pregnant women, because she does not want their mothers to feel the grief that she had to feel of losing a child. Blah blah blah now she's in Oakland.

Tempus Dominus (Temp): Ok, this one is super complicated. So the Greek god of time Chronos and Rhea (Titans born from Gaea and Uranus) had kids and stuff, but Chronos kept swallowing them whole as there was a prophecy that one of his children would overthrow him. Rhea asked her mother Gaea, or mother earth, to grant her children that will not be swallowed by Chronos. This was before Zeus was born who would eventually defeat the titans, freeing his siblings. Gaea told her that she was going to birth them soon, but it would take time to create them. Gaea basically kept Temp and a twin brother of his inside her and she planned on blessing infertile human mothers with them. They were born from different mothers on the opposite side from each other. Temp was born a millisecond before his twin. He was born in Ohio while his twin was born in Australia. Temp was the luckier of the twins and was blessed with Omnikinesis (the ability to mentally control anything and everything that exists, organic or created, existing now or in the future, right down to the molecular level.) He lived out his fake life like a normal human, but soon woke up in a strange place. He met Gaea, who would be considered his real mother. She declared him as a titan god and he was very confused. She showed him his true potential and awakened it. Temp did not know what to think about this. He began to test his abilities out, creating a timeline of his own to see what he can do. He learned how dangerous it can be and vowed never to go too far. That's when he discovered he was needed in the timeline where Oakland exists. He had to make himself a human form, since showing off his real look can    everything that sees it. He called himself Conner and made friends with this person named Aaron, who will later become KA. KA was also made from a god but born in a human. This is where KA also becomes king of Oakland and he eventually reveals his true name to Oakland, but not his true identity. Greek mythology is really confusing.

Locus Dominus: He is the younger twin of Temp, being born a millisecond after him. He was unlucky and was cursed. He was born with no   mothe, but for some reason did not require any nutrition. Surprisingly, nobody really bullied him for it and people would actually support him. His human family was super poor though. He could speak to people telepathically and is Omniscient (knows everything, which is ironic that he has no   mothe so he can't tell anyone). One day, he woke up thr the same realm Temp was taken to, but only a millisecond after. (Conversations in this realm take a millisecond in earth time) and met Gaea. She explained how he has been both cursed and blessed and she helps him discover his true abilities to control space to his will. He trained it a lot and never heard about his brother until the incident on the timeline with Oakland. Since he can bend space to his will, he traveled to this timeline, now on the search for Temp.

Tick: Abused as a kid one day Sophie found him and healed him and he lives in Oakland. Nothing really much.

Yick: born in 1993. Yick had a pretty good childhood. Had nice family. Yick was really into a lot of video games. One day though when Yick was a teen he was on his way to the arcade to play some games. But suddenly some masked person came behind him and threw him in a bag and took him to a lab. Then they injected him with a thing that made his voice extremely deep and old sounding. They also made it so Yick looked older than he really was. So after that, his family didn't recognize him and thought he was a stranger. Yick was left alone and homeless to rot. But one day someone found him. It was Tick. He was in his teens at the time after he ran from his insane parents. Tick had saw Yick and Tick saw those people who were injecting him. They almost injected Tick too. Tick's parent's injected Yick because Yick was Tick's mistake of a brother. So Tick helped Yick. Then they were adopted into a Japanese family but Tick ran away to Oakland due to him not getting cake on his birthday.  He got on a boat because he can't just swim. Yick just stays with the paw and the paw tries to figure out how to get Yick to not look old but he can never find out how. So then Yick flies a plane to Oakland and that's when he lives there.. Tick doesn't remember Yick though.

Malcey: born in 1983, Malcey grew up in Chicago, Illinois. Had a rough childhood. Discriminated. One day he traveled to a safe town near Oakland but a corrupt officer came and tried to arrest him so he ended up staying in Oakland.

Kali: Born in the 90s, He discovered a weird looking blackhole and was sucked into the year of 2023. Chet met Kali and they became friends. But Chet and Kali were suddenly sucked into another blackhole which led them into a time rip and they were suddenly in a town near Oakland that was abandoned and they met a robot named Ratchet.

Chet:

Ratchet:

Sally: Tick's CRAZY ex girlfriend who left Oakland and was never seen again.

Romoney baloney: Romoney baloney or RB was the hated child of the Romonian family. He used to be a Romonian but he one day found baloney and injected himself with baloney so now he's Romoney baloney.

Lamone: He was Romone's handyman but one day he messed up a cake and ruined Romone's life and tried to   hug and deceive the other Romonians. and Romone kicked Lamone out.

Valdor: creator of the Romonian planet, Planet X. He is the father of Romonians. He met Romone's mom and they had the kids. Then they had to move to a different planet. Idk.

Average Oakland kids: They were kids who were all abused but then came to Oakland. That's pretty much it.

Cleetus: Born in Kentucky, he had a very bad speech impediment, probably due to being so ridiculously southern and born in a not so smart family. He has an IQ of 24 and somehow got to highschool. He met his best friend Kurtis in *German voice* kindergarten and were friends since. In high school, he accidentally made Kurtis even stupider than him by messing with his invention in the science fair. After he dropped out of 10th grade, he got into cooking and was really good at it. He convinced his PAW to lend some money to start a cooking business, by that time his IQ actually rose to 48 so school wasn’t a waste of time after all. He realized he had to graduate high school to be able to do stuff like that, so he went back and got extremely lucky since he had a cousin that was in town who was a genius and did all the work for him. He graduated despite learning nothing and was able to open a restaurant with his paws money. He convinced the government to lend some money and let him open it. He called it Cleetus’ diner, but he wanted another manager to help him with this. He decided to hire his long time friend Kurits and renamed the place “Goofy Fellers Diner” It became super popular because the city they were in did not have many restaurants. It got closed down in less than a month from a failed health inspection after the guy found 50 rats making a village in the pantry (Kurtis’ idea). He decided to start a building service, since he was especially s  ed at engineering and building, despite his stupidity. He also included Kurtis in it. He and Kurtis were the best speed builders in the town and were praised for their building and fixing abilities. One day, they decided to move to a new location in Oakland, building them a giant barn there since crops grew really well there. They continued their business in Oakland and Kentucky. That was until Kurtis burnt the barn down and had to start from scratch to remake the original Diner. They built Sophie's lab and made so much money they were able to do it super fast. Everything else we know.

Kurtis: He was born in Kentucky but he was smart. He met Cleetus one day and Cleetus did an um and that resulted in Kurtis being dumb.

Oliver: Born in Iceland. He was an average kid with a good childhood. But Oliver had a mental disorder known as Peter Pan syndrome. Oliver is obsessed with other countries and he has always been really good in school. Oliver is obsessed with nature and is also obsessed with being "compassionate" and is very similar to how Gracie acts. He says EEEEE and stuff. Currently Oliver is 15 and drank a weird magic potion he bought from a nice witch to be permanently young. Oliver has multiple personality syndrome and he acts very very compassionate. He also can really seem to get angry. Like it's impossible. He will be introduced soon…

Wyatt: He was born with naturally   red  . His parents were horrified by his looks and threw him out into the streets and left. Later, he was found by his adoptive parents and it was not a good time. He was abused brutally and usual parent issues. It was so bad that he gave up everything when he was 15. He lost his ability to speak and can't feel any kind of emotion other than pain, since he's never experienced happiness or other normal emotions before. He also doesn't even know simple things in the outside world. He has a diary that shares the worst things ever. He is basically just a soulless husk. He found Oakland and had developed some sort of bond with Mariana.

Future

Welcome to the Oakland Folks, enjoy! I hate my job…

Narrator: It is yet another day in Oakland… *Sigh* I wonder what they are up to now.

Sophie: YA! STOP WATCHING THE PATRICK STAR SHOW AND DRINK YOUR STRAWBERRY MILK!

YA: Bwut I wike Pwatwick stwar show!

Sophie: GET OFF THE TV NOW!!!!! DON'T MAKE ME GET THE ROBOT AGAIN!

YA: NWOT THE WOBOT!

*The robot is a type of bot that will treat YA more like a baby.*

*Meanwhile with Troy.*

*Troy wakes up*

Troy: Man. What should I do today? Hmm… *looking at computer* I know!  I'll watch some Goat story 2 with Cheese! I love Mr. Broad when he says "Hahaha! He can't see, He has cataracts.” *watches goat story 2 with cheese while eating cheese. The king in the movie is sniffing and making out with the cheese.*

Sophie comes in.

Sophie; Hey Troy, Would you like some- WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING??????

Troy: Uhh. Goat story 2 WITH CHEESE.

Sophie: YOU ARE A LITTLE KID! YOU SHOULDN'T BE WATCHING THIS!

Troy: I'M 14!!!!! YOU KEEP US THIS WAY!!!

Sophie; Mhm! 😄 NOW COME AND GET YOUR STRAWBERRY  milk! 😡

Troy: NO. I HATE YOU SOPHIE! YOU ARE A FRICKIN MORON!

Sophie: THAT'S SO UNCOMPASSIONATE OF YOU, MISTER! YOU ARE COMING WITH ME TO THE HAPPY ROOM!

Troy: NO. YOU CAN'T CONTROL ME!

Sophie: Oh but I can, Troy! I CONTROL THIS TOWN. REMEMBER?

*Troy runs to Tick's room.*

Tick: Hey Troy. What's happening now?

Troy: SHE'S TRYING TO SEND ME TO THE HAPPY ROOM!

Tick: You won't be safe in here. And also, You should stand up to her. Maybe you should punch her and ride her down the stairs?

*Sophie enters and grabs Troy. She drags him to the "HAPPY" room*

Troy: GET AWAY FROM ME YOU PSYCHOPATH!! *Tries to kick sophie away but is too weak*

Sophie: We arent just going to the happy room, we are going somewhere EXTRA SPECIAL. *Takes him to the basement of the happy room. And ties him to a big chair* We’re gonna make you PERFECT

Troy: NO!!! LET ME OUT!!!

Sophie: *Connects him to thousands of needles with stuff in them, mostly strawberry milk. Somehow, she liquified fears and put them into one giant syringe that will give him his everythingphobia back.*

Troy: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!! *Screams like a police siren*

Sophie: There, all done. I hope you're happy in your perfect body! *Unties him and leaves*

Troy had been turned back into his 10-12 year old self. I think that's how old he was.

*Troy screams. He runs out the basement and out the happy room. He's trying to control his fear but he can't seem to control his new body.*

Meanwhile at Conner’s frozen custard…

YA and Nasha are eating together because YA finally learned something about Nasha. YA is eating strawberry custard with extra strawberry and Nasha is eating something, but I do not know what it is.

YA: I wove    custard!

Nasha: *Nodding*

Troy runs past the store screaming like a police siren. Nobody really pays any attention to him, until one day… a few random people move/appear into Oakland again. Weirdly enough, it is only 3 people. One is called Willos, one is Gracie, and the other one is Ash. Anyway, all three of them part ways into oakland. Willos eventually finds the lab first. Gracie is hungry and discovers red’s pizzeria. And that Ash has already begun to build something that seems like a pretty big project.

Meanwhile with Willos… he knocks on the door of the lab. Sophie answers, holding the baby-fied Troy as he screams more.

Willos: *Holding a cane* Good day, M'lady! My name is Willos! I seem to be lost here. Do you think you could help me?

Sophie: Why sure! Are you blind?

Willos: BLIND? WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT ABOUT ME???? YOU  Y FOOL!

Sophie: I didn't mean to offend you, I was just a g-

Willos: I AM GOING TO    YOU!!!!!

Sophie: Now that's uncompassionate of you!

Willos: WAIT A SECOND… I recognize that voice. Are you the infamous Sophie? I've heard stories about a lot of suffering going on here and I enjoy misery and PAIN. Are you that girl they call Sophie? Am I in Oakland? I've heard it from LC on my way here so that's how I know about Oakland.

Sophie: It's Temp!!!

Willos: YOU DARE CORRECT ME? I'M GOING TO    YOU IF YOU DO THAT AGAIN!!!!

*Meanwhile at Red's pizzeria with Gracie. Gracie enters*

Gracie: *Surprised anime eyes* OH MY GARLEY! IT'S A PIZZERIA! *Sees Red* AWWWWW! IT'S A BEAR! I WANNA HUG IT!!! 😍

Red: Oh God please no… *Sigh* Welcome to Red's pizzeria! What can I help you with?

Gracie: *Running around excitedly* EEEEEEE!!!!! I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUUUUUCH!!!!

*Gracie calms down and talks calmly*

Gracie: Sorry I get excited… So uh.. Where am I?

Red: You're in Oakland.

Gracie: Did I get too excited? I uh. Kind of annoy people with my excitement…

Red: Don't do that here. You'll get   ed.

Gracie: Alright. I guess I'll just go and leave you be. Before I go though, Could I please get a spicy jalapeno wasabi pizza with spicy cheese and meat?

Red: Uh. Ok. You might   from the heat but if that's what you want, Ok.

Gracie: I can handle ANY AMOUNT OF HEAT!!!

Red: Suit yourself. *Makes the pizza and brings it to Gracie.*

Gracie eats it and she is fine.

Gracie: Mmm! Delicious! Thank you Mr. Bear- Wait, I almost forgot! What's your name?

Red: It's.. Red.

Gracie: EEEEE!!! SO CUTE UWU!!!!

Suddenly, a very tall man comes in with a giant poster.

Ash: HELLO THERE ONE AND ALL! DO YOU WANT T' WITNESS THE BEST SHOW IN THE WORLD? WELL COME ON DOWN T' THE WELLINGTON THEATER!!!! *Gives everyone a poster*

Red: Um, who are you? Where are these people coming from?

Ash: I AM ASH WELLINGTON, PLEASED T' SEE YA EXIST MR… *Looks at sign* RED! *Shakes hand rapidly* MY BIG OPENING SHOW IS IN A WEEK, SO BE THERE! *Leaves*

Red: Uhhh… Ok. I wonder how she is doing. *Looks back at Gracie.*

Gracie: *Running around excitedly and saying EEEE*

Red: Get outta my pizzeria. NOW SCRAM.

Gracie: Okay.. *Goes to the goofy fellers diner*

Cleetus: WELL HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWDY THERES FELLER!

Kurtis: OH MY GOLLY! But shes ain't pertey. My plate juices is perter than hers.

Cleetus: GET RIDS OF THAT PLATE JUICE!!!!!

*Gracie is looking at Cleetus, Confused.*

Gracie: Uhh. Can someone give me a tour of this town? I uh don't know where I am.

Cleetus: WHY SURES I CAN! UH. HEY KURTIS, WATCH THE SHOPS!

*Cleetus and Gracie starts walking around the town*

Cleetus: So uhh you like my shops?

Gracie: *Chuckling* You're funny! But let's be friends. I have had bad experiences with boyfriends. I know you don't want to hear my drama.

Cleetus: I have nose ideas what you saids but you are sure as heck perty!

Gracie: That's sweet but I don't want a boyfriend. I just want friends!

Cleetus: What's uh boyfrind?

Gracie: You are so silly!

Cleetus: I may be goofy but I'm also dumb.

Gracie: Okay, Well I can help you understand the meaning! So a boyfriend is basically someone you love that's a guy! It's usually a girl's thing.

Cleetus: Do guys do thats?

Gracie: Uh. They can but it's uh. Weird

Cleetus: What's a weird?

Gracie: Weird is basically something that is disliked by people or not normal.

Cleetus: Am I weirds?

Gracie: No! You're goofy. Or silly!

Cleetus: I think Kurtis is weirds.

Gracie: *Chuckles* Yeah, He is kind of weird! What is plate juice?

Cleetus: I DON'T EVENS KNOW! HE JUST MADE IT ONE DAY! HAHA, PLATES JUICE! I'M KURTIS AND I CANTS LIVES WITHOUTS MY PLATES JUICE?

Gracie: Well seriously though. What is plate juice and why does Kurtis love it?

Cleetus: Uh. Well I think it's some sorts of dirty sink water mixed with dumb spit.

Gracie: You know, Maybe this town isn't so bad. I may like it here! My last town had a super crazy girl who would hypnotize everyone! Haha, It sounds crazy but the only reason I moved was because I don't like hypnosis and I don't like the paranormal. I just want a nice peaceful town that I can call my home! And I want cool friends like you, Red and whoever else lives here! We may not get along but boy, I won't be in their way if they are angry! I kinda avoid Red. I think I made him angry. I should apologize.

Cleetus: Naw, he just has a short tempums. He is nice, but I thinks oaklands changed him in a ways.

Gracie: Oh, Poor bear. Wait. Is he a robot? He looks kinda like a robot or a stuffed animal. No offense.

Cleetus: Nones takum. He's a robots. Uh. He used to be a humans named Adam but he uh got   eds by a manager called Jerry and thens he became a robot.

Gracie: OH MY GOSH! Poor Red…. I want to help him become human but-

Cleetus: Naw, He prefers being a robots.

Gracie: Alright. I respect that. So what does Red do besides owning a pizza place?

Cleetus: Asks Romone. He knoes more than mes.

Gracie: Okay. Well I didn't want to say this in front of Kurtis but you are much smarter than him.

Cleetus: *Blushes* WHY THANKS YOU! You are the pertyest person my eyes have ever saw!

Gracie: Aww! That's sweet. Well, I guess I better find Romone's!

Cleetus: We've been standing Here's talking when we could've just been touring! I am so sorry! Let's go ons with the tour!

Gracie: No! It's my fault. I am a very talkative person. Let's go on with the tour. You have my full attention. And if you ever need help with anything, Don't hesitate to ask! I'll be there in a flash!

Cleetus: Okays.

*Cleetus does the tour*

After tour

Cleetus: Alrights Gracie, Well it was nices meeting yous. I gotta get backs to the dineums now.

Gracie : Bye Cleetus! I'll see you later!

Gracie: Now to get to Romone's palace.

*She goes to the palace*

*Gracie knocks on the door*

Romone: Why hello there- *Eyes pop out* WHY H-H-HELLO! UH I WASN'T EXPECTING A GIRLFRIEND- *Looking at Gracie awkwardly* Uh. Ahem. Sorry. I just haven't seen someone so pretty around here much.

Gracie: It's okay! So I am new to Oakland and I was just stopping by to see if you wanted to invite me in to get to know you more?

Romone: Sure. Come on in.

Gracie: Wow. I am surprised! You really just will let a stranger into your house?

Romone: Yup. This is Oakland. Nothing makes sense here.

Gracie: Huh? What do you mean? *Enters and eyes light up as I see the amazing decor of the palace* hold that thought because… EEEE! I JUST LOVE YOUR DECOR!

Romone: Oh why thank you! Cleetus and Kurtis built it!

Gracie: Oh! Okay! This is fancy! Maybe they can build me a house!

Romone: Yeah! So uh what would you like to know about Oakland? And uh. First of all I must ask, What's your name and story? How did you get to Oakland?

Gracie: Well, I left my old town called "Potnuk" due to resets and mind control. I vowed to never stay in a town like Potnuk ever again.

Romone: OH. Uh. Well hehehe, You won't ever find that in this town! *Gulp* So tell me Gracie, If Oakland was to be a crazy, Insane town, What would you do?

Gracie: Either I'd try to stop it, Or I'd just leave! Or I would resolve it peacefully. BUT IF THIS TOWN IS BRAINWASHING KIDS, then I'M GONNA BE SO MAD AND ANGRY THAT I WILL STRANGLE THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE!!

Romone: *Eyes wide and nervous* Hehe, Uh well just uh don't go to the lab!

Gracie: I hate it when I have to see all those kids suffering. But I'm not crazy, I once hired this babysitter who literally was trying to treat the 12 year old kid like a baby. WHY WOULD SOMEONE FORCE A CHILD TO ACT YOUNGER? YOU ARE JUST GROOMING THEM! AND THAT'S WHAT I HATE ABOUT BABYSITTERS AND PEOPLE WHO FORCE KIDS TO DO STUFF! IF THEY WANT TO BE THEIR AGE, LET THEM BE! DON'T FORCEFULLY FEED THEM STUFF AND TREAT THEM LIKE A BABY! THAT'S NOT OKAY! Anyways, What do you like to do, Romone-

*Romone has exited his palace and has ran off to the lab.*

Gracie: Romone? Where are you? *Starts looking around*

*Meanwhile with Romone*

Romone: SOPHIE. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT RESET OAKLAND OR TREAT KIDS LIKE BABIES! WE HAVE A NEW GIRL IN TOWN AND SHE WILL    YOU IF YOU DO THIS!

Sophie: Hahahah. We are immortal, Silly!

*Gracie finds Romone*

Gracie: Hey Romone, Who are you talking to?

*Sophie looks at Gracie nervously*

Sophie: Hi! I'm Sophie! Welcome to my lab! Excuse me for just a moment! I need to fix something!

*Sophie grabs all her reset and brainwash gadgets and throws them out the window into the squid pool. She makes everyone appear normal.*

Sophie: come on in, Gracie!

Gracie: Okay!

*Gracie looks around and is so amazed. She notices Troy screaming and bumping into a wall*

Gracie: Who's that?

Sophie: Oh, that's just my kid Troy! He loves with me along with many other kids. I'm like a babysitter.

Gracie: A babysitter, Huh? What do you do to these kids, Huh?

Sophie: Nothing! Just give them some strawberry milk and let them watch TV! Though Troy and YA, *making up some story* They were born with a condition that makes them act like little kids and they can't snap out of it so I have to treat them like babies as it's the only thing good for them. And Troy has everythingphobia, meaning he is scared of everything.

Gracie: *Looking at Troy* AWW! That's so sad! I thought you were forcing children to be babies. Sorry I just have a bad experience in my old town. It was beautiful looking just like this and everyone was a kid but there was this guy or girl and they controlled the town. Very similar to this town but it wasn't called Oakland. I moved to this because I don't like brainwashing and resets. AND ANYONE WHO BRAINWASHES OR RESETS A KID WILL BE PUNISHED BY ME! AND I DON'T PLAY AROUND… Anyway, That's about it!

Sophie: Uh Gracie, Can I talk to you in private?

Gracie: Sure!

*Sophie pulls Gracie into her room*

Sophie: Listen Gracie, I have a confession. I'm a psychopath. I… I turn kids into babies. At first, It was fun! I thought I was doing good, but I became too obsessed. Now I can't control myself. PLEASE HELP ME! I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE BUT I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT KIDS!!!!! *Crying* PLEASE HELP ME BECOME NORMAL! I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS TYPE OF PERSON ANYMORE! I'M CRAZY AND INSANE!

Gracie: WHAT??? *Thinking for a moment* Hmm. Listen. I can help. But I want you to swear with an oath that you will NEVER do this again. And you will not force anyone to do anything. You will let Troy and YA be whoever they want to be.

Sophie: I got it! But how will you help me?

Gracie: I gotta go inside your mind. Lemme just shrink down first! *Shrinks down using shrink ray. Hops on Sophie's hand and enters through ear*

Gracie: Hey Sophie, You alright?

Sophie: Yes!

Gracie: Ok now where is her brain… *Finds the brain* Wow. This is huge! Lemme just crawl on in and see what her mind looks like.

*Enters Sophie's mind and sees all the psychotic things. But she sees her happiness and joy side is blocked.*

Gracie: *Spits on two hands and   hugs together and breaks the wall with bare hands* HIYA! There we go.

*The psychotic things go away and Sophie is FINALLY NORMAL!!!!!!*

*Gracie exits Sophie's mind*

Sophie: I'm going to go apologize to everyone now.

*Sophie apologizes to everyone but Tick as he will apologize later*

Later

Sophie enters Ticks room

Sophie: Hey Tick… Listen, I-

Tick: GRRRRRRR! GET OUTTA MY ROOM SOPHIE!!!

*Sophie comes to Tick, Picks him up and hugs him. She takes him downstairs and makes him some pancakes with extra syrup.*

Tick: Huh? Why aren't you force feeding me strawberry milk? And you never let me have pancakes?

Gracie: *Behind Tick* That's because I fixed her!

*Tick jumps and turns around*

Tick: JEEZ! YOU SCARED ME!

Gracie: Ha ha, Sorry! I should've warned you! So yeah I just entered Sophie's mind and   friendm, She apparently had all her normality blocked so I unblocked it and now she's happy! But you look a little depressed, Tick. Mind if I take a look at your mind?

Tick: NO.

Gracie: Then I'll just use my telekinesis. *Uses telekinesis to look in Tick's brain* AHA. I knew you were traumatized by Sophie! Now let's just fix that and …. Done! How do you feel?

Tick: Well I don't wanna say GRRRR!

Gracie: That's because you felt constant pain.

*Gracie goes over to Red's pizzeria.*

Gracie: Hi Red! *Excitedly jumping*

Red: Hello. What do you want?

Gracie: I want to hug you!

Red: No.

Gracie: Why can't I ever talk to you? 🥺

Red: I have work to do. I have no time for simple human interaction.

Gracie: Pwease?

Red: No.

Gracie: What work do you have to do?

Red: Important work.

Gracie: Can I help?

Red: …can you cook?

Gracie: Yeah! I can! And I am pretty fast!

Red: Hmm. We'll see about that… Show me what you got.

*Gracie creates a pepperoni pizza in 30 seconds*

Red: I'm not going to question what happened. You got the job.

Gracie: EEE! THANK YOU SO MUCH!

Red: Yeah, Sure.

Gracie: Can I watch you work?

Red: No.

Gracie: Please?

Red: No.

*10 hours of please later

Red: For the 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 time, NO.

Gracie: PLEASE? I WANT TO HELP YOU?

Red: No. I am a robot. Not human. I am fine with what I do.

Gracie: PLEEEAAASSSEEE????!!??

Red: NO. EITHER YOU WORK OR GET OUT!

Gracie: FINE.

*Gracie leaves and bumps into Willos*

Willos: Ouch. Where's my cane?

Gracie: *Gasp* SIR? ARE YOU OKAY?

*Willos gets his cane and gets up*

Willos: WHO BUMPED INTO ME?

*Gracie hugs Willos*

Gracie: I AM SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SORRY!

Willos: It's quite alright. Could you please let me go?

Gracie: No!

Willos: LET ME GO YOU IDIOT!

Gracie: THAT'S NOT VERY NICE!

Willos: PLEASE LET ME GO?

Gracie: Nope! If I let you go, You might hurt yourself. So I will walk you back to your house.

Willos: My house should be a giant fun house. It says "Willos fun house"

Gracie: Your name is Willos? Pleasure to meet you! I'm Gracie!

Willos: I feel weird when I am around you and I don't like it.

Gracie: Haha, That's just my magic!

Willos: I appreciate you dropping me off to my house.

Gracie: It's no problem! Are you new here too?

Willos: Yes, I am. If I could see, I would walk over to my house but I can't see.

Gracie: Well don't worry, We are almost here!

*Now at Willos house*

Gracie: Here we are!

*Willos feels around and can tell it is his house*

Willos: Thank you, Gracie. I shall leave now.

Gracie: No problem!

*Gracie notices Cleetus and catches up to him.*

Gracie: Oh hey Cleetus! Whatcha doing?

Cleetus: I'm just getting rid of the plate juice. I may need your helps.

Gracie: Hmm. Ok. I can help!

Gracie: *I grab some water and gargle it then spit the water out in the sink. All the plate juice is finally out* I STILL TASTE IT! BLEH! *I drink some of my fruit smoothie I somehow made* AH, MUCH BETTER!

Cleetus: What the- Uhhhh. Why do yous have a smoothie in yours pocket?

Kurtis: Wells I'm dumbs. I needs it to stay dumbs.

Gracie: That's all?

Kurtis: I needs it. I NEED IT! I CAN'T LIVES WITHOUTS IT!!!!!

Gracie: Why?

Kurtis: STOPS USING BIG BRAIN WORDS! I NEEDS PLATE JUICE!

Gracie: Hmm… What if I could make plate juice that doesn't smell bad or taste bad to other people?

Kurtis: NO.

Gracie: I know! How about I put your plate juice in a shed next to the diner? That way you can just walk outside and drink it and Cleetus won't complain.

Kurtis: NO.

Gracie: Hmm. How about we do a bet. You drink my smoothie for 2 days and see how you like it. If you like it, You give up plate juice forever and I get to dump it out but if you don't like it, I never touch your plate juice again, Sound good?

Kurtis: Uhhhhhhh. Okays.

*Gracie puts the plate juice in my magic pocket and puts the smoothies in the plate juice cabinet*

Kurtis: This'll bes easums.

Gracie: Oh yeah? You think you won't like it? Well this smoothie is supposed to taste good. It is magical. And nobody can resist this. I know you won't. And just to make sure you don't throw it away, I'll have my magic watch over this diner. If you even try to throw it away, You will be pushed away from the trash can. Have fun!

Kurtis: I WON'T EVEN DRINKS IT!

Gracie: Until you complete this challenge, Your plate juice will be with me. So unless you want your plate juice, You better drink up! Oh and don't worry about side effects because the only side effect is you'll have is the drink tasting so good! Also if you drink this you may have a more improved mood and you'll be able to focus. If you like it, I can make it so it is exactly like plate juice and if you don't like it, I'll leave your plate juice alone.

Kurtis: Okays.

*Gracie leaves the diner and goes to the lab to hide the plate juice*

*Meanwhile with Kurtis*

Kurtis: NO PLATE JUICE? WHATS AM I GONNA DO? I GOTTA DRINKS THAT SMOOTHIEUM! W-Wells. Heres goes nothin… *Drinks one of the smoothies* *I try to lie about it tasting bad but I can't seem to lie how it tastes* IT'S SO B- GOOD! NO! I CANTS LIES! I JUST WANT TO STOPS DRINKSIN THIS!!! *I notice the bottle flies over to me and I look at the rest of the drink.* NO. I'M NOT DRINKSIN THE REST! NOBODY CANS MAKES ME!

*Kurtis hears a voice. (Magic controls the diner now to make sure Kurtis is doing the challenge)*

Voice: Are you sure about that? So you want your plate juice back, Kurtis?

Kurtis: UH. I'M GOING OUTSIDES TO CLEAR MY HEADS!

*Kurtis tries leaving but the doors lock and Kurtis is trapped*

*meanwhile with Gracie*

Gracie: Great job helping me teach Kurtis a lesson, Sophie! I'm glad I could borrow your magic staff to help Cleetus stop going insane!

Sophie: No biggie!

*Back to Kurtis*

Kurtis: LETS ME OUT!

Voice: I'm sorry but I can't do that! Drink up!

Kurtis: NO. NEVER.

Voice: It looks like you are enjoying your life without plate juice. What a shame it's going to be all gone.   friend hoo. *Sarcastic voice* Do I have to force you to drink this?

Kurtis: NO. I WILLS NEVER!

Voice: I'm sorry but I don't take no for an answer. I was specifically spawned by Sophie to help with stuff.

(Later on)

*meanwhile, Gracie is walking in the woods when she comes across a big ol mansion (Mike's home)*

Gracie: Ooo! A mansion! I'm gonna enter cause I am a idiot!

*She enters as the door was unlocked because the door is made of wooden planks so it is not very efficient. It is very spooky inside and gives off the feeling of overwhelming dread and fear.*

Gracie: Wow! This sure is scary! But I don't usually feel fear!!

*She goes upstairs and finds a big throne, though it is empty. A figure appears behind her.*

Mike: Hyello Intruder.

Gracie: *Turns around* Haha! You scared me, Buddy! Sorry for breaking in, I just wanted to see what was in here! I didn't mean to break in!

Mike: …you break into home completely oblivious that person might live there. What kind of human are you? Do you like to intrude? Do you have   wish? *Doors and windows shut*

Gracie: I don't usually break into houses. I just break into spooky houses. Also, I heard the screaming of children so I'm curious what's in here.

Mike: …is basement children who intrude. They were not friendly, so they are stuck here forever. Who are you anyway?

Gracie: I'm sorry for breaking in, The name's Gracie! I just wanted to meet everyone in Oakland so I uh. Just broke in here thinking nobody lives here. Sorry but I just have a tendency to get too excited and break into places.

Mike: …you are lucky lady, you know? You would already be in basement by now, but… I like you. *Doors and windows open* I am Mike. I move here recently in hopes to escape. I sort of regret, but I need to keep sister safe from scary world.

Gracie: Oakland isn't safe? What do you mean?

Mike: I mean outside Oakland. Real world. She can't handle it, her mental state is too frail. (He is obsessed with keeping Nasha safe)

Gracie: I am so sorry. Can I meet your sister if you don't mind? I know I just broke in without knocking but I want to help.

Mike: Normally I would, but I have not seen her lately. I think she run away. I cannot find her.

Gracie: Then I'll find her for you, Mike! Do you have any idea where she could be?

Mike: Somewhere alone, preferably forest, since it is only place where you can be alone. It is scary though, the nature speaks. Is weird. Do not fall for their nurturing.

Gracie: What even is Oakland? Why is nature speaking and nurturing?

Mike: …I dunno. Go now, save sister.

Gracie: Ok I won't let you down!

*Gracie goes to the forest and sees Nasha. She is crying loudly and her cold aura is freezing the nature, but the nature continues coming towards her trying to hold her*

Gracie: *Pulls out a sword from my magic pocket and cuts the nature down. I come to Nasha and sit down next to her* Hey, Are you okay? I won't hurt you.

Nasha: *Broken English* fwiend no fwiend more!! Depress, wun, bye bye swelf (YA not friends anymore, Got depressed, ran away, and wanted to bye bye herself)

Gracie : Your friend broke up? You are sad and you want me to run? No. We're going to get your friendship back! What's your friend's name?

Nasha: ya…

Gracie: Well I don't think YA would want you to cry. We are going to fix this. Trust me.

Nasha: O-kay.

Gracie: Now uh. How do we get back to Oakland? We are a little far from there. Let's go ask Mike. Follow me to Mike's place -

*Nasha is going back inside. Gracie follows*

Gracie: Mike? I found Nasha! But we need to get back to Oakland! Do you have anything that can get us there quickly?

Mike: I have electric bike.

Gracie: Ok, great! I’ll bring it back, I promise!

Mike: Oh, is not my bike. You can keep.

Gracie: Not your- *Remembers basement children* …right. Ok, bye!

*They ride back to Oakland.*

Meanwhile back with Kurtis… He might've gone insane.

Kurtis: I AM NOTS DRINKING THE DRINK! YOU CANTS MAKES ME!

Voice: Don't make me force feed you this. Just drink it.

Kurtis: *Acts like I broke my throat and arms* I brokes my throat!

Voice: No you didn't. You are fine. Just drink the drink… You started this challenge and must finish it…

Kurtis: NO.

Voice: Don't make me feed this to you forcefully. Just drink it. You'll like it. It's not going to    you.

Kurtis: NO. *Closes   mothe*

Voice: OPEN YOUR   mothe.

Kurtis: NO.

Voice: You asked for this. *Kurtis   mothe is forced open and he is force fed the smoothie.* Swallow it.

Kurtis: *Shaking head*

Voice: SWALLOW. NOW. *Kurtis   mothe is forced shut.*

*Kurtis swallows the drink*

Voice: Good. Now that wasn't so bad! Was it?

Kurtis: NO MORE!

Voice: You must drink this for two days. If you don't do it, Your plate juice is gone.

Kurtis: GRRRRR. I AMS GONNA ESCAPES AND GETS MY PLATE JUICE BACKS!

Voice: You can't escape. The door is locked.

Kurtis: What if I needs foods?

Voice: You are surrounded by food. You are fine. There's no excuse. Just DRINK THE DRINK FOR TWO DAYS. IT WON'T    YOU! ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DRINK THIS VERY GOOD AND VERY HEALTHY DRINK!

Kurtis: NO.

Voice: Okay then. Looks like we're going to have to do the YA treatment on you then…

Kurtis: AHHHHHHHH! LET ME OUT! GRACIE!!!

Voice: She can't hear you. She's not even there. She's gone out doing something.

Kurtis: SHE LEFT MES?

Voice: Yes. How "sad". I don't care. NOW GET OVER HERE SO WE CAN GET THIS OVER WITH! DON'T MAKE ME TURN YOU INTO A KID.

Kurtis: I CANTS be turneds into a kidsum.

Voice: Wanna bet, Dumbbell?

Kurtis: YOUS LISTEN HERES VOICE IN MY HEADS! YOU CANTS TELLS ME WHAT TO DOS! I WILLS FIND A WAY OUTS! I'M SMORTER THANS YOU THINK!

Voice: Your voice says otherwise. Your IQ is literally 5.

Kurtis: *Grabs a battering ram and tries to break down the door but it doesn't seem to move*

Voice: Hahaha! You are locked in. Just stop resisting and GET OVER HERE SO I CAN MAKE SURE YOU DRINK THIS.

Kurtis: NOES! I WONT LOSE!

Voice: Oh, But you will! This smoothie is too delicious for you to resist. And if I have to force you down on the floor to drink this, I WILL MAKE SURE YOU DRINK THIS!

Kurtis: NOES. YOU CAN'TS AFFECT MES! MY BRAINS IS SO DUMBS I CAN'T BE MANIPULUMS.

Voice: You trying to sound smart is getting on my nerves… TIME TO END THIS.

*A magic force grabs Kurtis and prevents him from moving. He is now being force fed the drink. Kurtis is trying to resist the smoothies but he is enjoying it.*

Voice: Enjoying that smoothie, KURTIS?

*The force lets him go as he isn't trying to run anymore.*

Kurtis: MMMM! THIS IS DELICIUMS!

Voice: It even has all the same effects as your old drink which I won't say as if I say it then you might snap out of the magic effects.

Kurtis: MORE SMOOTHIES.

*While Kurtis is being brainwashed, Let's go back to Gracie and Nasha*

They are close to the lab still riding on the bike.

Gracie: So, what's Oakland like? I hear lots of strange stories.

Nasha: *shrugs shoulders*

Gracie: do you speak another language? I am fluent in a lot of languages! (I would think so CAUSE SHE CAN LITERALLY DO EVERYTHING)

Nasha: r-russia..

Gracie: You speak Russian? I can do that! (Speaking russian) where did you come from?

Nasha: (russian) Russia…

Gracie: Oh, you actually come from there? Awesome! What brought you and Mike here?

Nasha: Mike is scared that I will get hurt in America. We escape Russia because bad government. America also bad, We escape to here. Mike is good brother. I am bad sister…

Gracie: Oh, that's terrible… I'm sorry you had a rough time in Russia and America. Do you like it here?

Nasha: *shrugs*

Gracie: Well, we are at the lab now.

They knock on the door and they here Troy screaming because the door noise scared him and the wall also scared him, oh and also the TV which was playing goat story 2 with cheese scared him. Sophie answers.

Sophie: Hi.

Gracie: Hi.

Sophie: So uh what did you come here for?

Gracie: Well I found Nasha in the forest crying because YA stopped being a friend? I want to talk to him.

Sophie: Oh. Come on in.

Gracie: Ok.

Sophie enters.

Gracie: Where's YA?

Sophie: I think he's in the happy room.

Gracie: Ok. I'll go

*Gracie goes to the happy room*

Gracie: Woah what is this place? *Sees YA and Troy kissing*

Nasha: *Crying*

Gracie: I'll handle this.

*Gracie grabs Troy and puts him next to a different kid. Troy and that kid are now   friends.*

YA: NWO!   friendOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Gracie: (In Russian) There Nasha, Now you can be with YA.

Nasha: YAY!

*Gracie goes to Romone's to ask about Red*

Gracie: *Sneaking up to Romone*   friend

Romone: AHHHH! *Turns around* GRACIE? YOU SCARED ME SO MUCH THAT I ALMOST MELTED INTO A CANDY PUDDLE!

Gracie: Hee hee, I love doing that!

Romone: AND YOU DID IT IN MY EAR? I COULD'VE GONE DEAF!!!

Gracie: Sorry! I'm just always so excited! 😆

Romone: It's ok. JUST DON'T COME SCREAMING IN MY EAR AGAIN! I COULD GO DEAF!

Gracie: Don't worry! You won't go deaf! I'll just be more quiet next time!

Romone: *I eat some of my calm down cake* What do you want?

Gracie: Missed me already? I came here to talk about Red!

Romone: He didn't    you for being annoying?

Gracie: I'm not annoying! I'm just excited! What's annoying mean? Is that a game?

Romone: Nevermind what that means! If I tell you about Red, WILL YOU GET OUT MY PALACE?

Gracie: Yeah!

Romone: OK. So what do you want to know about Red?

Gracie: Why is he always so depressed? He's a bear! He should be happy!

Romone: Are you really this stupid? HE'S A ROBOT! WHAT DO YOU NOT GET?

Gracie: I know he's a robot, Silly! He's just such a cute bear!

Romone: Don't you think everything is cute? I barely even know you. Earlier you were so much more calmer and NOT CRAZY! NOW YOU'RE ACTING LIKE SPONGEBOB!!! I feel like I'm Squidward!

Gracie: Ooo! I'll call you Squidward from now on!

Romone: THEN QUIET!

Gracie: I CAN'T BE QUIET! I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!! EEEEEEE!!!

Romone: THAT'S IT. WE ARE DONE HERE. *Kicks Gracie out the palace and slams the door. Starts to scream and bangs head on the cake table.* THAT GIRL IS DRIVING ME MAD!!!!

Bamone: She is kind of annoying though.

Camone: Yeah! Even the Romonian of Compassion can't take her!

*Gracie sees a open window of the palace and jumps in it.*

Gracie: *Laughing* Yay! I got in! Hey Romone! Why'd you lock me out?

Romone: GET OUTTA MY PALACE! *Squidward voice*

Gracie: What? Am I annoying you? I'm never annoying!

Romone: IF YOU DON'T GET OUT THE DAMN HOUSE THIS INSTANT, I'M GOING TO- … I can't do anything… JUST GET OUT!

Gracie: *Sees the cake and eats it* Mmm! Yummy!

Romone: WHY YOU LITTLE-

Bamone: GRACIE, LEAVE! YOU ARE DRIVING ROMONE CRAZY!

Gracie: What's the magic word?

Romone: *Snaps* LISTEN HERE YOU LITTLE S**T, WE CAN EITHER DO THIS THE EASY WAY OR THE HARD WAY. EITHER I CALL TICK OR I KICK YOU OUT. What's it gonna be?

Gracie: WHO'S TICK?

Romone: *Calls Tick and Tick appears*

Tick: I DON'T WANT THE HAPPY- *Sees I'm in the palace* Oh. Hello Romone. What do you need?

Romone: GRACIE IS DRIVING ME INSANE!!!!

Tick: Gracie? Really? You think she's more insane than Sophie?

Gracie: *Hears "Sophie and insane" and turns around. Now has a serious tone* What? Sophie's insane?

Tick: You didn't know that?

Gracie: No! I thought this was a perfect town! And uh. Sorry Romone. I uh. Get hyper too much.

Romone: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! *Trying to process the sudden change in Gracie's behavior.*

Tick: Uh. We'll just see ourselves out. *Leaves with Gracie*

*Romone is so confused and is banging his head on the table*

Romone: WH- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

*Meanwhile with Tick and Gracie*

Gracie: Did I really get a little too hyper? I didn't mean to…

Tick: Well you do confuse people a bit but you're not insane. Romone has sorta been through a lot of adventures recently so he's normally like this. *Sees Cleetus still confused about Gracie.* Cleetus is always confused with normal people.

Gracie: I don't understand. What is Oakland? Why do people say it's "Not normal"? Did I eat too much sugar and am hallucinating or did you say Oakland was not normal?

Tick: You aren't hallucinating. And for some reason, Sophie seems to be acting strange around you. It's like Everytime you are around, She just acts not insane but when you are gone, She's her chaotic self.

Gracie: I don't understand.

Tick: Follow me to Red's. We will talk about this somewhere safer.

*Tick takes Gracie to Red's*

Red: Welcome to Red's pizzeria- Oh great… Gracie…

Tick: Hey Red, Can I crash here for a bit? I need to talk to Gracie about the Oakland thingy.

Red: She doesn't know about Oakland?

Gracie: I did some research but everything I saw was all positive stuff!

Red: Come in. But don't do that thing you did earlier.

Gracie: Aye aye, Captain!

*Gracie and Tick enter*

Tick: So yeah, Gracie doesn't know about Oakland apparently. Usually when people arrive, They already know everything about Oakland. But for some reason, Not only do the Oakland effects not change Gracie into a child but Gracie seems to make Sophie act normal. But what's strange is that Gracie doesn't seem affected by Oakland. And when I'm around her or when anyone else is around her, Sophie just doesn't do anything. It's like Sophie is repelled by Gracie.

Gracie: Well I do smell like roses! Hehehe! And I also have this tendency to go hyper and then act calm!

Tick: But for some reason you aren't affected by Oakland's aging system. How old are you, Gracie?

Gracie: 20! But I have the mind of a hyperactive kid.

Tick: So how long have you been acting like a kid? Did you always act this way or did Oakland make you feel like a kid?

Gracie: Nope! I've always been this way.

*Sophie is about to reset Oakland*

Red: Oh no. I sense another Reset…

Tick: Wait a second… Gracie, You said you don't like brainwashing, Right? Well now you can witness what I mean by what Oakland is. Look out the window.

*Gracie looks out the window and sees Sophie resetting Oakland. Though for some reason, Gracie is still normal. As she sees this, She exits the pizzeria and angrily comes to Sophie.*

Gracie: DID I JUST SEE YOU BRAINWASH SOME CHILDREN?

Sophie: *Turns around* Yeah? So what? I control the town! And I think it's time for me to stand up to you and TURN YOU INTO ONE OF THE OAKLAND KIDS!!! MUHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!

Gracie: *Grabs the reset button* I THOUGHT YOU CHANGED! YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO BE NORMAL!

Sophie: Well I lied! And because I control this town, EVERYDAY WILL BE THE SAME! AND YOU WILL BECOME COMPASSIONATE!!!!

*Gracie pushes the reset button hundreds of times*

Gracie: *Doesn't affect me.* Oh! Looks like it's not working on me! *Smashes the button and grabs Sophie* YOU BRAINWASHED THE KIDS. I TOLD YOU I WOULD NOT BE HAPPY!

Sophie: I'M IMMORTAL AND CAN'T  !

Gracie: Hmm! We'll see! *Drags Sophie out of Oakland*

Sophie: NO! LET ME BACK IN!

*Gracie locks Sophie out of Oakland*

Gracie: There we go. Now to destroy this button…

*Gracie destroys the button.*

Gracie: These resets will just keep coming back. I have to find the source…

*Gracie sees the source of all the resets. It's in the form of a dog.*

Gracie: AWW! A PUPPY- NO! SNAP OUT OF IT, GRACIE! THIS IS THE SOURCE… NOW I HAVE TO… Take it out of Oakland.

*Gracie takes the dog out of Oakland but the resets still keep coming back*

Gracie: WHAT?

*Meanwhile with Kurtis*

Kurtis: AHHHHHH! GETS ME OUT!

Voice: No escape! Now drink up!

Kurtis: NEVER! I DEFIES YOUS!

Voice: You can't escape. I already told you. You aren't smarter than me! And you never will be. NOW DRINK THE DAMN DRINK!

Kurtis: NO! NEVERS! ANDS I MAY BE STUPID, BUT AT LEAST I HAVES A BRAIN! NOW SHOWS YOURSELVES!

Voice: Puny Kurtis, You are a goofball. You could never defeat me.

Kurtis: REALLYS?

Voice: Yes. Now DRINK.

Kurtis: FIGHT ME!

Voice: I would have to enter your mind to do that.

Kurtis: THEN GETS IN MY MINDS!

Voice: Okay, Whatever you say!

*Voice enters Kurtis mind*

Kurtis Grabs a reset button that Sophie accidentally left*

Kurtis: Times to  , I AIN'T GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT!

*Kurtis presses the reset button causing him to actually forget everything about himself. But the thing is, Kurtis just   ed the source of the resets.*

*Back to Gracie*

Gracie: *Realizes Kurtis* I FORGOT ABOUT KURTIS! But wait a second, The sky is clearing up and the magic is fading… Could this be the end of the resets?

*Gracie sees Sophie is now her normal self.*

YA is still YA but he's back in TX with the doggie. This causes Nasha to spiral down into an even larger depression.

But luckily Nasha finds someone else. Who could it be? YC!

But we forgot! Ash Wellington has finally finished his project… A theater? I wonder what he'll do with it.

*Meanwhile with Kurtis and Gracie*

Gracie sees Kurtis knocked out. The diner is destroyed.*

Gracie: *gasps* KURTIS! ARE YOU OKAY? WAKE UP!

*Kurtis wakes up*

Kurtis: Uhhhs, Does I nose you?

Gracie: It's me, Gracie! Remember?

Kurtis: Who?

Gracie: I guess he erased his memory…

*Cleetus comes back to the diner and is mad about the diner being destroyed*

Cleetus: KURTIS YA GOOFBALL!!!!!

Kurtis: Whos is hes talksin to?

Cleetus: YA GOOFBALL, YOUS KNOW!

Gracie: Kurtis lost his memory! He   ed the resets.

Cleetus: uhhhhhhhh.. what's 1+2?

Kurtis: uhhhhhhhhh 4? (The answer was not 12, which shocks cleetus)

Cleetus: *GASP* OH NOSE!!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *he was so sad that he moved back to Idaho (tater land).*

Kurtis: Uhh what's?

*Ash Wellington appears*

 Ash: (everyone can hear this) HELLO EVERYONE!!! MY SHOW WILL BEGIN IN 1 HOUR!!! BE THERE. Or else. SEE YA THEREEEEEE *Disappears*

*1 hr later*

*Everyone is now in a big ol theater. Even Kurtis.*

*the show begins*

Ash: *does an epic dance routine* WELCOME ONE AND ALL T' THE WELLINGTON THEATER!!! IM YA HOST, ASH WELLINGTON!! TODAYS SHOW IS A GAME SHOW!! I NEED 2 VOLUNTEERS!

*Willos appears on stage.*

Mike also goes on.

Ash: ALRIGHT!! THE THEME O' THE GAME IS… *Spins epic wheel* OBSTACLE COURSE!! *Au nce cheer sfx. The course appears, it is super violent and deadly* FIRST T' CROSS MOVES ON T' THE NEXT ROUND!! READY…. GO!!!!!

*Mike is getting through it very easily.*

Willos can't even find the beginning of the course.

Mike wins.

Ash: Wow!!! What an amazing show of s  !! Willos is the loser, so he has t' spin the punishment wheel! *spins wheel. Most options or almost all are the most deadly, gruesome and violent punishments ever, worse than saw. It lands on watching an endless rant* The punishment will be… ENDLESS RANT!! We have a special guest for this punishment. SO… INTRODUCING, THE ONE, THE ONLY, TARA HEBBLER!!!!

Meanwhile somewhere in Kentucky…

Cleetus built a new goofy fellers diner and it got super popular because from where he is, there isn't many restaurants let alone shops. He turned it into a store as well, kinda like a cracker barrel. With all the money he got, he built a super barn, which is just a barn, but much larger. Cleetus is stinking rich, though he doesn't act like a Richie cause he doesn't know what that is. Cleetus is living his best life.

Back to the show…

Willos had snuck off during the rant. (Going to ruin the show)

Ash: Hey guys I got popcorn and- WHERE IS HE?! UHHH… LETS CUT T' COMMERCIALS AS WE FIND THIS MAN.

*Commercial time! :)*

Narrator: IT'S TIME FOR SOME COMMERCIALS!

Commercial 1:

*Tick is walking around Oakland. He's chewing gum and throwing wrappers on the ground. He accidentally spits out his gum and it is caught in his shoe*

Tick: *horrible acting* Oh! No. What's? This? A gum has been caught on my shoe! Whatever will I do?

*Ash appears*

Ash: THEN YA GOTTA GET ASH'S GOOD OL' RELIABLE GUM REMOVER! It removes dirt o' anything off the bottom of ya shoe! So hurry up everyone! Before it's too late! For just one payment o' $12.99 ya can get a BRAND NEW GUM REMOVER! Details sold separately. Ash is not responsible for any injuries or cuts you may have with the gun remover. (You know, The fast talking in the commercial)

*Tick scrapes the gum off with ease*

Tick: Oh wow! Thanks Ash!

Ash: NOOOOO PROBLEM! SO COME ON FOLKS! BUY YASELF THE BRAND NEW GUM REMOVER! $12.99!

*Commercial 2*

Ash: Hey there folks! While I go hunt down Willos, Mike will do my second commercial then we'll be right back t' the show!

Mike: But I do not know how to read script- *sigh* Ok, I try to read it.

*Commercial 2*

Mike: *Enters with Maxwell house cawfee. Tries to speak in a country accent but fails so gets Sophie to do the commercial* well I done all I could do. *Goes to sit back down in the seating in au nce*

AND YOU CAN EVEN GET A FREE "SCARY VIDEO"!

*Commercial ends*

Troy: SCAWY VIDEO!

YA: *Screaming in au nce* SWO HOWRRIFYING!

*Meanwhile, Let's see what Ash has been doing before the commercial started*

*Ash leaves the theatre*

Ash: Oh Willos, Where are ya?

*Ash sees Willos putting a gift on the ground. (What Ash doesn't know is it is a bomb.*

Ash: What are ya doing, Willos?

Willos: Oh nothing! Just putting a gift over here for later! It's SO GOOD, IT'S THE BOMB!

Ash: GET BACK IN THE SHOW NOW!

Willos: Lemme just finish something up! I'm making a cake for the winner of the show!

Ash: *Stops for a minute* A cake?

Willos: For the winner of the show! Unless you already have prizes?

Ash: O' COURSE I HAVE PRIZES!

Willos: Well guess what Ash? This prize is A BOMB AND IT WILL EXPLODE IN 5 SECONDS AND DESTROY THE WHOLE THEATRE! NOW YOU'LL ALL COME TO MY FUN HOUSE!

Ash: I already came prepared. This THEATRE is EXPLOSION PROOFED!

Willos: IF I COULD SEE YOU RIGHT NOW THEN I WOULD-

Ash: JUST COME BACK T' THE SHOW! o' else…

Willos: OR ELSE WHAT?

Ash: OR ELSE SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN T' YA…

Willos: HAHA! I AM MORE CRAZY THAN YOU. WHATEVER YOU CALL BAD, I CALL MEDIOCRE!

Ash: GRRR! GET BACK IN THE SHOW!!!!

Willos: I THINK I'LL JUST RUIN THE SHOW!

Ash: ON THE COUNT O' THREE, I WILL END YA. 1…

Willos: Is that a threat?

Ash: 2…

Willos: I DARE YOU TO SAY THREE.

Ash: 3!!! TIME T'  !

Willos: Actually, I think it's time FOR YOU TO  ! *Pulls out a flamethrower*

Ash: *Pulls out a   weapon that is not as powerful as a flamethrower* YOU WILL COME BACK T' MY SHOW O' SUFFER CONSEQUENCES!

Willos: I beg to differ, ASH.

Ash: CURSE YA, WILLLOS!!!!

Willos: I HATE YOU TOO!

Ash: THIS IS GOING NOWHERE. HOW ABOUT THIS WILLOS. Since we are both insane, How about ya come complete my show then after the show, Ya take them t' your "fun house" o' whatever it is supposed to be.

Willos: If I win your "show" WHAT DO I GET?

Ash: I bet you want a new attraction t' your fun house, Don't you?

Willos: Well, I need a new attraction that'll   ANYONE WHO COMES TO TOUCH IT.

Ash: Well how about we propose a deal, Willos? Ya win my show Everytime I host it and get whatever the heck ya need for ya "fun house" but if ya loose, YA MOVE YA STUFF AWAY FROM OAKLAND AND I WILL BE SUPREME!

Willos: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. I'll win your stupid show. BUT NO CHEATING TO MAKE ME LOOSE. IF YOU CHEAT, I AUTOMATICALLY WIN. I read your rules in the show and I am going to use them against you.

Ash: I am a man o' my words, No cheating! Now GET BACK T' THE SHOW!

Willos: OKAY!

*They enter back into the theater*

Ash: ALRIGHT EVERYONE! LET'S CONTINUE THIS SHOW! SO FAR, MIKE IS IN THE LEAD BUT WILLOS MAY BE CATCHING UP! Anyways, Hope you folks ENJOYED COMMERCIALS! ONTA THE NEXT CHALLENGE! I CALL IT "THE IMPOSSIBLE COURSE 3: WIN O' LOOSE". HOW THIS WORKS IS EACH PERSON WILL BEGIN AND RUN UP A RAMP. THEY'LL HAVE T' PARKOUR OVER SWINGING SPIKE BALLS AND IF THEY FALL, THEY FALL IN LAVA. ONCE THEY ARE PAST THE BALLS, THEY MUST AVOID ACID RAIN, IF THEY STILL MADE IT PAST THAT, THEY MUST PARKOUR OVER A WALL AND THEN THEY MUST JUMP INTO A POOL OF WATER AND PUSH 20 BUTTONS. IF THERE IS A TIE, THEN WE WILL DO A LAST COURSE AND IF THE CONTESTANTS BOTH WIN, THEY BOTH GET A PRIZE! Anyways, LET'S BEGIN!

*Willos begins to jump on the spikes and lands on the other side without falling. Mike also lands on the other side without falling. Willos starts to run up the wall with his cane and once he reaches the top, He jumps off the wall and lands on his cane fully balanced on it. Mike also runs up the wall and slides down the wall to the other side. Willos avoids the acid rain successfully and Mike also successfully avoids the acid rain. Lastly they both jump in separate pools and somehow at the same time, Push all the 20 buttons and win. It's a tie.*

Ash: LOOKS LIKE IT'S A TIE, FOLKS! ONTO THE LAST CHALLENGE! EACH CONTESTANT MUST CLIMB UP A GIANT NEEDLE AND BALANCE PERFECTLY ON THE TOP OF IT! WHOEVER CAN STAY THERE THE LONGEST, WINS!!!! BE CAREFUL! AS IT IS A VERY SHARP NEEDLE!

*Willos and Mike climb up the needle and both balance perfectly. Willos doesn't even wobble. He just stands perfectly still and balanced even though he's blind and can't see. Mike is also perfectly still. An hour later, They are still on the needle. They are still both balanced on the needle. Ash is starting to get impatient so he start wobbling both needles. Willos balances on the needle and his cane. Mike starts to loose a bit of balance but still stays on the needle. Willos is just doing magic tricks while balancing on the needle. Mike is starting to worry if he's going to loose. Another hour passes by and Mike loses his balance and is about to fall when Mike quickly jumps off the needle and lands perfectly on the ground. Doing 5 backflips. Willos is still balancing on the needle. After a couple more minutes, He jumps off the needle and lands on the top of his cane. Willos wins but Ash did push both of their needles so technically Mike and Willos both win.*

Ash: Well this is a first, Folks! It seems I have cheated and pushed Mike off so unfortunately there is no loser t' this show. I was really hoping to see someone loose but it looks like Mike and Willos are both good at balancing and parkouring and both mastered all the courses so WILLOS AND MIKE ARE THE WINNERS! Next time I will pick the weakest person in the au nce! Why did I pick Willos and Mike if they were going t' be this good? I don't know… Anyways folks let's see what Willos and Mike have won!

*Ash spins the wheel and for Mike it lands on a new scooter.*

Ash: Mike has won a brand new scooter!

Ash: Now let's see what Willos has won… *Angrily spinning wheel. It lands on "choose your prize".* Well Willos has to choose his prize! *Sighs* choose ya prize, Willos.

Willos: EVERYONE COME TO MY FUN HOUSE!

Ash: Well I guess that's what he wins… TUNE IN NEXT TIME TO SEE THE MOST DEADLIEST SHOW IN OAKLAND! NEXT SHOW IS NEXT WEEK AT 6PM! DON'T BE LATE!

*Everyone except Ash leaves the Theatre*

Ash: How did Willos win yet he was horrible at the beginning? It doesn't make sense… I THINK HE CHEATED!!!! How can I prove it though? Hmm. NEXT SHOW I WILL CONFRONT HIM! AND HE WILL PAY!!!! I WILL BE HIS ARCH NEMESIS! *Laughing like the sociopath he is*

*Meanwhile, Willos takes everyone to his fun house*

Willos: WELCOME TO MY FUN HOUSE! COME ON IN!

*Everyone enters*

Willos: NOW… EXPLORE MY HAUNTED HOUSE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GO TOO FAR! THIS PLACE IS INFINITE WITH INFINITE ROOMS SO YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN!!! Now… SCRAM AND EXPLORE! *Laughing like an evil   enemy*

Troy: *Tries to leave but door is locked* AHHHHHH!!

Sophie: Troy, YA, Just stick with me and you'll be fine.

*Sophie, Troy and YA enter a random room. Troy and YA scream. Sophie is confused*

Troy: G-G-G-GHOST!!!!

*Sophie sees nothing but a regular room*

Sophie: Ok you two, Calm down! Here I have some strawberry  milk!

*Troy and YA drink it and are still screaming and terrified*

Sophie: I'm going to go check on the others. Just stay here and I'll be right back.

*Sophie goes to find the others*

YA: *Seeing millions of ghosts* AHHHHHHHH!!!!

Troy: THEY'RE HERE TWO HWAUNT UWS   friend!

YA: PWEASE WEAVE US AWONE, GWOSTS!

*A ghost is laughing at Troy and YA*

Ghost: I'm bored of scaring. I've been bored for 100 years!

Ghost 1: I agree. I think it's just getting old. Scaring isn't as fun as it used to be.

Ghost 2: Maybe we can get out of this house? Willos has been keeping us here for billions of years. Well, His family has. He's just another guy trapping us ghosts in this house. WHY CAN'T WE BE FREE?

Ghost: Maybe these children can help us? Hmm… Well they seem scared.

Ghost 2: They do look scared. Ah, Scaring used to be so fun but alas, It's just old now. We should probably help them calm down.

Ghost: But how?

Ghost 3: They seem to like the thing they call "Strawberry milk". Maybe if we give it to them, They'll be calm.

Ghost: *Goes up to Troy and YA.* psst. Hey. You kids want some strawberry milk?

*YA and Troy look at the ghosts*

Ghost: Don't be scared! We can give you strawberry milk. You just have to help us first.

*YA and Troy nod while shaking WITH FEAR*

YA: OWKAY. What dwo ywou want us two dwo?

Troy: YWEAH! WHAT BWOO SWAID!

Ghost 2: Free US, You numbskulls!

YA: I wike nig nagging!

Ghost: You talk weird. Lemme just fix that. *Enters YA's mind and makes him the ranty YA*

YA: AHHH! I'M CRINGY!

Ghost: Good. Now unless you want to be a cringe person forever, YOU WILL FREE US.

YA: OKAY! I'LL STOP NIG NAGGING AND FREE YOU!

*YA exits the room and tiptoes out the fun house with the ghosts*

Ghosts: YAY! FREEDOM!

*They forgot to change YA back.*

YA: Hey Troy. Guess what I can do?

Troy: *Screaming like a police siren*

*YA gets a car. He tapes Troy to the car and starts driving it. Troy is screaming like a police siren*

YA: YAY! NOW I OWN A POLICE CAR!!!! WEE WOO!

*Troy is still screaming. YA runs over Tick.*

Tick: *Gets up and is angry at Troy* TROY! YOUR OBNOXIOUS SCREAMING IS HURTING MY EARS!

YA: I think he needs a shot!

Tick: Right. He's late for his DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

*Troy screams like a police siren and YA grabs a magical tater*

YA: MYYYYY MAGICAL TATER! HEY WHERE IS IT BY THE WAY? OH THERE IT IS! UNDER ME! MYYY MAGICAL TATER! FLIES INTO THE DOGGIES   mothe *Jasmine somehow appears*. AND IF SHE FAILS, SHE EATS THE TATER AND SPITS IT OUT! CUZ ITS MAGICAL. MYYY MAGICAL TATER IS A BASKETBALL! I THROW IT TO THE DOGGIE AND HE EATS IT UP! MYYYYYY MAGICAL TATER! C419 MINECRAFT PE!

YA suddenly remembers dumping Nasha, he should probably apologize. He goes to Mike’s mansion by Tick driving the Troy car there. He knocks the door.

Mike: Hyello?

YA: Can I see Nasha?

Mike: Uhhhh, ok. She is upstairs in first room to right.

YA: Ok.

He goes upstairs and peaks into her room. Nasha is happily drawing and talking with YC, despite YC having no clue what she is saying.

YA: NASHA???

Nasha turns and sees YA. She doesn't seem very happy, but continues talking to YC.

YC: *Terribly singing i'm on the edge*

Nasha: *Laughs* Silly!

YA: *Grabs a mallet and smashes the window on the door screaming like a maniac*

Nasha looks scared.

YA: I MAKE VIEWS EVERYDAY. JUST FOR YOU GUYS WATCHING MY CRINGY VIDEOS! You wanna hear a SCARY VIDEO? *Coming to YC and Nasha with a mallet* WELL HERE'S ONE!

*Mike hears this stuff going on and enters Nasha’s room.*

Mike: What’s going on here? *inaudible sound that was probably a gasp* YA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO NASHA?

YA: *Turns around* Oh nothing! Just playing with a mallet!

Mike: How did you find mallet?

YA: I brought it here! Nasha and YC SURE LOVE MALLETS!!!!

Both of them shake their heads.

YA: THEN IF YOU CAN GUESS WHAT VIDEO I'M ABOUT TO MAKE, I WON'T SMASH!

Mike: I think we've had enough of your company today. *Grabs YA with his scary burnt hand* How about you leave or I have to make you leave by force. *Trying to sound calm*

YA: I will be BACK. CRINGE SPIRIT WILL GET WHAT HE NEEDS!

Mike: What is cringe spirit? Are you possessed by something?

YA: PLEASE HELP ME- AHAHAHA I WILL    YOU YA!

Mike: That explains a lot. *Mike grabs a "spirit extractor” that he got from Sophie and extracts it into a vaccum.*

YA: I feel much better now. Now I should apologize to Nasha.

Nasha is backed into a corner. YC jumped out the window

YA: N-Nasha… I'm sowwy I was mean and tried to attack you. I just love Troy so. You and YC seem to be getting along, maybe you guys can be together? Pweaaaaase I'm sowwy!! PWEAAAAASE!

Nasha thinks for a bit before giving YA a hug. I guess she forgave him.

YA: OH NO, I NEED TO TURN OFF MY TWOY CAR!! *jumps out the already broken window*

Troy is still attached to the car screaming like a police siren.

YA take the tape off. Troy does what he usually does

YA: I'm sowwy   friend.

Troy: waaaaaaaa

*They drive home*

Meanwhile…

Gracie is still trying to meet new people, but she doesn't know who else she needs to meet. She remembers the theater and goes there. Ash is in there… smoking? His usual psychotic smile is not there.

Gracie: Hi there!

Ash jumps and throws the cigar at her in self defense.

Ash: YA WONT GET MY TAXES IRS- oh. Uh.. *Puts back on his fake smile* What can I do for ya?

Gracie: I just wanna meet new people, I completely forgot about you! I'm Gracie! *Pulls out hand*

Ash: Gracie, huh? Pleasure t' meet you! *Shakes hand intensely* I am Ash Wellington, owner o' the world famous Wellington Theater!

Gracie: your world famous?

Ash: Sure!

Gracie: woah, that's awesome! I was wondering if you would like to join me on a little field trip.

Ash: hmmmmm a field trip ya say? Where ya taken us?

Gracie: I don't know. I just want to explore Oakland and meet new people, possibly going to the town next door, Spuceville!

Ash: *thinks violently* It's a deal then, partner! *Shakes hand again* I'm gonna need someone t' manage my theater while I'm gone though. OH CHIVES!!!!!

Chives the butler appears.

Chives: Yes sir?

Ash: I'm gonna need ya t' take care o' my theater while I'm out, think ya can handle that?

Chives: Very well sir. At Least this is better than working for Goodman.

*Ash and Gracie leave and go to Spruceville* (They will meet Cam, Kam, Temp, KA, and those other characters that haven't been introduced to them yet. We'll also learn about Ash's origin quite soon. Also another note, Ash kinda has an irish accent, not new york, so some words will be spelled differently like of and or is o' you is ya and to is t')*

They first meet Kam and Cam.

Gracie: HELLO! *Yelling in Cam's ear*

Cam jumps and turns around. Angry.

Cam: WHAT THE HECK? WHO SCREAMED IN MY EAR?

Ash: It was Gracie. I may be crazy but I'm not so crazy I'd scream in people's ears!

Kam: Uh. Hi. I'm Kam ane and this is Cam.

Ash: You're both Cam?

Kam: I'm Kam with a K. He's Cam with a C.

Ash: Pleasure to meet ya, Kam with a K! The name's Ash Wellington and this h're is Gracie. I actually own a theater not too far f'rm here and I'll be making a show next week! Be there at 6:00 PM. OR ELSE..

Cam: Or else what?

Ash: Uh. I'll force you to pay taxes.

Kam: NOT TAXES! I HATE TAXES!!!!

Gracie: I don't even know what that is!

Ash: Well it twas good seeing you two Cams.

Kam: Uh. Yeah. Bye.

Cam: BYEEEEE!

*Gracie and Ash are walking to the next place in Spruceville*

Gracie: So Ash, Do you have a crush?

Ash: Why would you ask me that?

Gracie: I think you like meeeeeeee!

Ash: I DO NOT LIKE YOU SIMPLETON- Uh I mean. No.

Gracie: Why are you hiding your true self?

Ash: I'm acting quite normal!

Gracie: Well you said "Uh I mean." Which automatically means you are hiding something from me… And I'll have you know that I can see right through you…

Ash: *Nervous* What are you talking about? Preposterous!

Gracie: I think you are hiding something about yourself! Come on… Let it out!😏

Ash: I'M PERFECTLY OKAY!

Gracie: Aww come on… I know you are hiding something!

Ash: I'M NOT!

Gracie: *Coming towards Ash to give him a hug* Come on!

Ash: GET AWAY FROM ME YOU PSYCHOPATH! I CAN EASILY MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING NIGHTMARE! NOBODY MESSES WITH ASH WELLINGTON!!!

Gracie: There it is!

Ash: WHAT?

Gracie: I can see right through your nice act. Just cut the act! I know you are secretly crazy!

Ash: I'm quite normal!

Gracie: Well what about your "show"? You're always making it dangerous! Are you insane? Just tell me! Spill the beans! I want to hear all the details…

Ash: Now listen here, woman. I do not tolerate you criticizing my perfect show. If I hear one more critic out of ya, I'm gonna do things that even I might regret. Ya hear?

Gracie: Okay! I didn't mean to offend your show. I was just trying to see your true self. I wasn't offending your show in any way.

Ash: *smile fades* why do ya want to know so badly?

Gracie: Because I care about people and you look like you are hiding something and don't want to talk about it.

Ash: if ya wanna find out what my deal is, you should just climb up my brain and find it for yaself. *Sarcastic voice*

Gracie: Ok! *Shrinks and climbs up Ash and enters his ear*

Ash: im sorry, what are ya- I DIDNT MEAN IT LITERALLY, GET OUTTA MY EAR!!

Gracie: No! I'm going to see what is really going on! Hehehehehhehe!

She enters his brain, it's pretty big somehow. She goes into the memory area and sees a headset where you can watch someone's life from beginning to present.

*Gracie puts on headset and watches origin*

*27 years ago…*

Somewhere in Dublin, Ireland…

There is a 7 year old Ash and his mother watching a circus.

Young Ash: mama, when I grow up, I wanna bwe a magician.

Petunia: do ya now? You know magic is fake, right?

Ash: nwo it's not! See look! *points at magician who eats a sword* wowwwww!

Petunia: that stuff is very dangerous. I don't want to see my little lad  getting hurt.

Ash: I won't get hurt mama! I'm a big strong boy!!

Petunia: Sure you are. *chuckles*

Skip 3 years…

Ash: mama.. pwease don't gwo…

Petunia: (she is sick with bad disease) my little lad , do not fret. You know we will meet again someday. I will be with you at all times. *points at his heart*

Ash: mama, pwease…

Petunia  s.

One year later…

Ash is at school getting bullied.

Bully 1: haha!! What a weakling!

Bully 2: Your shoes look so musty!

Ash: …shut up. *he is very weak and frail. After his mother's  , he stopped eating and his father forces him to eat but he throws it up*

Bully 3: I bet your dead mom is disappointed in you!! I bet she never loved you!

At this moment, Ash finally snaps. He beats the bullies up, breaking the arms of the first one, the legs of the second one, and slamming the third ones face into a locker multiple times. His father taught him defense stuff like karate so he knows. After doing that, he felt… good. Watching evil people fall before him makes him happy.

5 years later…

Ash is a menace to society in his town, as he had commit many crimes against humanity. One day his father came to confront him.

Sean: son. You've caused too much chaos in our town. *he is the president of Ireland* I need you to leave this country at once.

In a blind rage, ash   ed his father and fled the country.

10 years later…

Ash built his first theater to fulfill his goal of being a "magician". He watched many game shows on the American television and was inspired. Although, he created a little twist to his shows. He upped the violence about 10k percent. He would also kidnap people and forced them to do his show or they would  . They would usually   anyway from the violence of the show. This carried on for 8 years before he got bored and went to Oakland as he learned about how chaotic it is. That is all.

*Gracie exits Ash's mind and her eyes are wide*

Gracie: UHHHH. *Throws up*

Ash: So, how was ya visit?

Gracie: I'M CONCERNED NOW.

Ash: Ya like what ya saw?

Gracie: You are a CRAZY PERSON! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

Ash: because they wronged me, humanity wronged me. I needed payback. Society got what they deserved.

Gracie: I feel so sorry! I wish I was alive to help! And people were so mean to you and you had to put up with that! What if I could help you run your Theatre?

Ash: How do ya suppose ya can convince me t' do such a thing?

Gracie: Well what if I help you advertise your show and help people come to your show without being scared and afraid to enter your theatre? The best part is you'll get lots of money and I can help with your uh. Past.

Ash: my shows… weren't about the money. Twas about sending a message t' society. About what happens t' them when they wrong someone.

Gracie: Well what if I can help spread that message? I can be just as evil as you!

Ash: you aren't evil at all, lad . You are a goo  two shoes who only cares about compassion and such.

Gracie: YOU WANT ME TO BE EVIL? I'LL BE EVIL! IF IT'LL HELP YOU WITH YOUR PAIN.

Ash: *grins as he likes watching this* really? How about ya shake on it?

Gracie: OH HO NO! I AM ONLY BEING EVIL TO HELP YOU! IF YOU TURN ME INTO A PSYCHOPATH I WILL NEVER HELP YOU AGAIN. But another good thing is I can help pay for those taxes you owe…

Ash: ITS A DEAL PARTNER (He doesn't like taxes) *Shakes on it*

Gracie: now. BEFORE YOU SHAKE, I AM GOING TO REMIND YOU AGAIN. I AM ONLY BEING EVIL TO HELP YOU WITH WHATEVER PAIN YOU ARE HAVING. I'M NOT BEING PERMANENTLY EVIL. If you agree, We will shake on it. *Shakes*

Ash: Alrighty then.

Conveniently enough, Temp had been watching this whole thing

Temp: Uh, hi?

Gracie: Hello! Who are you?

Temp: Tempus Dominus, or uh.. Temp. I'm the god of timelines. And I live here.

Ash: The name's Ash Wellington and this is my partner in training!

Gracie: We made a deal about something… So I guess you're the last person here?

Temp: Not exactly. I uh, heard about your little past shenanigans and maybe I can be of help to you, Ash?

Ash: Trust me, I'm way beyond helping.

Temp: I am literally the god of time and timelines itself. I'm sure I can do something. Let me ask you this. *darkens everything where it's only Ash and him* if you could live your life from the very beginning again with all your past memories, would you change it?

Ash: hm.. I.. I would.

Temp: how so?

Ash: I wish my mother didn't have t'  .

Temp: Let's make a little deal. I'm gonna do my little time thing, and you'll have your mother back. BUT, only under one condition. You just never use your trauma against people again. Basically, just don't be violent. Do we have a deal?

Ash: anything for mother. *Shakes hand*

Temp does a weird hand thing and grabs onto Ash, taking him back to the past.

Dublin, Ireland, 25 years ago…

Petunia: *coughing*

Young Ash: what's wrong mama?

Petunia: nothing, dear. I just have a small fever.

*later that night*

Temp: Ok, Let's get to work.

He puts some sort of strong medicine into Petunia's tea. She drinks it and goes to sleep. The next morning, she wakes up feeling very well.

Temp: My work here is done.

He goes back to the present. He looks to Ash, who is no longer there.

Temp: Oh, right.

Gracie: Huh, I feel weird. Hey, who are you?

Temp: uh… nobody. *disappears*

Gracie: Huh, weird.

In Ireland… Ash is now a world famous show host, even people in Oakland know him.

Gracie: What was I doing?

Temp: *reappears* Meeting everyone in Oakland. And Spruceville. You're in Spruceville right now.

Gracie: Oh yeah! Well it was nice meeting you! I guess I'll be going to save everyone from Willos now.

*Gracie goes to Willos*

Gracie: Hello Willos. Can I talk?

Willos: *listening to Ash Wellington on TV* WHAT DO YOU WANT? (Ash in background: Oh, that question is a doozie! How are ya gonna get it?)

Gracie: I WANT YOU TO FREE EVERYONE!

Willos: NO! I AM NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU!

Gracie: I don't take no for an answer! Now Pwease free everyone?

Willos: NEVER.

Gracie: What if I could make you not blind?

Willos: NOT BLIND???

Gracie: Yes!

Willos: THAT SOUNDS GREAT!

Gracie: Well how about you free everyone then I'll help you?

Willos: Hmm. FINE. I'LL FREE EVERYONE. *Unlocks the doors and allows everyone to exit* now cure my blindness!

*Gracie sticks out her tongue and runs away*

Gracie: HAHA! I TRICKED YOU!

Willos: NOOOOOOOO I NEED TO FIND THE SWITCH!

*Gracie breaks the switch*

Gracie: Oops! I broke it!

Willos: GRRRRRRRRRR!!!! CURSE YOU GRACIE!

Gracie: You gotta catch me! Ehehehhehe! *Runs out fun house*

Sophie: Thank you, Gracie! Um. I guess we'll get going now…

Romone: *Drops plate* OOPS I DROPPED A PLATE!

Gracie: *Remembers that I still have the plate juice for Kurtis* uh. I'll be right back!

*Gracie goes over to Kurtis and gives him plate juice*

Kurtis: What's this?

Gracie: Plate juice! You like it!

Kurtis: Uh… I haves noes ideas.

Gracie: *Gives Kurtis plate juice*

Kurtis drinks it and starts to remember Cleetus and Oakland*

Kurtis: Where's Cleetus?

Gracie: He's in Kentucky.

Kurtis: WHAAAAATS? WHY?

Gracie: He couldn't handle your stupidity so he left.

Kurtis: WHYS DIDS YOUS MAKES ME DOS THAT CHALLGUMS?

Gracie: I didn't mean for it to go this far! Sophie was the one who gave me her magic to do that so I have no control of what happens!

Kurtis: CLEETUS COME HOOOOOOOOOOOOME!

Gracie: Aww! You really miss Cleetus don't you?

Kurtis: YEAUHS!

Gracie: Well cheer up! I don't want to see you down in the dumps.

Kurtis: HOWS CAN YOU BE SO HAPPUMS? I JUST LOTS MY BEST FRIEUND!

Gracie: I can't be sad!

Kurtis: YOUS GIVES ME BACKS CLEETUS!

Gracie: How about you ask me later?

Kurtis: GIVES ME BACK CLEETUS!

Gracie: Mmm, Try again.

Kurtis: I'M GONNAS GO INSANES!

Gracie: Oh no! What's wrong?

Kurtis: *Grabs a cup of plate juice and dumps it on Gracie.*

Gracie: What? What I do?

Kurtis: GIVES ME BACK CLEETUS!!!!!!

Gracie: What? He's in Kentucky silly! We can't get him!

Kurtis: *Bangs head on wall* I HATES THIS! I JUST WANTS TO GET CLEETUS BACKS!

Gracie: Cleetus? Oh no! What happened-

*Kurtis grabs a baseball bat and knocks Gracie out*

Kurtis: I'M COMIN FOR YOUS, CLEETUS! I'MS GOING TO KENTUCKY!

*Gracie gets back up after two seconds*

*Kurtis throws Gracie into Red's pizzeria*

Gracie: Hey Red!

Red: What do you want?

Gracie: Can I watch you work?

Red: No. GET OUT OF MY PIZZERIA!

Gracie: No!

Red: NOW.

Gracie: Why? What I do?

Red: *Kicks Gracie out the pizzeria and into the Troy car*

Gracie hits Tick who is fixing it.

Gracie: HEY TICK!

Tick: OW MY BACK! YOU LANDED STRAIGHT ON MY BACK!

Gracie: DON'T WORRY TICK, I'LL FIX IT!

Tick: NO! I'M TRYING TO WORK ON THE CAR!

Gracie: I'M COMING!

*Gracie throws herself at Tick's back and fixes it*

Gracie: There! Now let me help with the car!

Tick: I can do this on my own Gracie!

Gracie: No! I helping!

Tick: I can do this on my own, Gracie!

Gracie: PWEASE LET ME HELP!

Tick: LET ME FIX THIS MYSELF!

Gracie: NO! YOU'LL HURT YOURSELF! *Grabs tools and runs*

Tick: I THOUGHT YOU WERE NORMAL! GIVE ME BACK MY TOOLBOX!

*Tick grabs the toolbox and fixes the Troy car*

Gracie: I SAID I WANNA HEEELP- Oh. It's done!

Tick: SEE! I CAN FIX IT!

Gracie: Wow! You fixed it all on your own?

Tick: YES! I FIXED IT!

Tick: I CAN'T TAKE YOU ANYMORE! YOU'RE WORSE THAN SOPHIE!

Gracie: Wait Tick! What I do?

Tick: DRIVE ME CRAZY!

Gracie: LEMME GIVE YOU A HUG!

Tick: NO!

*Gracie eventually leaves everyone alone and Tick goes crazy again.*

Meanwhile at Mike's house…

Nasha is a super fan of Ash's show ever since Mike bought her a cute little TV. She always wanted to go see his shows. Mike comes in.

Mike: hyello sis, I want to talk to you.

Nasha: *Eyes glued to TV watching Russian translation of Ash's show* mhm?

Mike: I have surprise for you.

Nasha: *Turns around*

Mike: I bought 5 tickets to the Ash show you like.

Nasha: YAYYYYYY *Hugs Mike*

Mike: you can pick 3 other people to join you. We leave tomorrow. *pats her head* (He a good brother)

Nasha runs out of the house to search for 3 people to join her. She goes to the lab

*She invites YC, Tick and Troy.*

The next day, they go fly to Ireland. They get a hotel close to the theater. Nasha jumps on bed with excitement driving Tick a little insane since Gracie already made him insane.

Tick: please.. Stop.

Troy: *jumping on bed even though he is scared of bed noises* WAAAAAAA

Mike: Ok I know you are excited, but some people have to sleep. Not me though. *Leaves room*

YC is just playing on his switch.

The next morning, they go to the theater.

Ash: WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO THE WELLINGTON THEATER, I'M YA HOST, ASH WELLINGTON!!! *Everyone cheers*  (Mike is translating it for Nasha)

Nasha: YAAAAAAAAAY

Ash: Let's spin the wheel o' games t' see what today's show will be! *spins giant wheel* Today's show will be.. TALENT SHOW! I will get two people teo show some kind of talent, anything you put your mind to! The person who gets the most votes wins! I need two volunteers!

Everyone is raising their hands.

Gracie and Troy come up.

Ash: You will be first, what's ya name, miss?

Gracie: Gracie! I'll be doing some gymnastics!

The crowd goes wild

Ash: WOW! WHAT AN AMAZING SHOW OF TALENT!!! I WONDER HOW THE OTHER CONTESTANT CAN TOPOP THAT OFF! Now how about you kid? What's ya name?

Troy: Twoy.

Troy: Uh. I'm going to drink tons of strawberry milk and see how long I can drink it before passing out!

Ash: Hm. An interesting test indeed. Let's not keep the au nce waiting! *steps back* wait… How's he gonna get it?

*Troy grabs strawberry milk from Gracie's pocket*

Gracie: Uhh. How'd that get there? Must be magic! *Pulls out hot dog* HEY HOW'D THAT GET THERE?

The au nce laughs.

Ash: Heh…

*Troy drinks about 100000000000 bottles of Strawberry milk and is now very fat.*

Troy: YAY! I WIN!

Ash: wow… What an amazing show of thirst! I don't even know how he even got all that milk!! Alrighty then, time for the voting to commence!! *there is a barcode to vote for the best act on screen*

*They vote for Gracie*

Ash: Looks like we have a blowout! Gracie is the winner!

Troy starts to scream like a police siren

Ash: Oh don't cry me a river o' tears now, kid. Your act was quite impressive too!

Troy: Weallwy?

Ash: Of course!! Now that we have a winner, let's see what they win!! *spins wheel of prizes*

*Gracie gets a brand new scary video*

*Troy scrams so loud, he throws up all yhe strawberry milk and floods the entire Theatre.* Ash stands in shock. Everyone is covered in strawberry milk.*

Ash: …MY THEATER!!! KID, DO YA KNOW WHAT YA JUST DID??! HOW MUCH THAT COSTED ME TO BUILD?!

Troy: *screams*

Ash: I THINK YOUR SET FOR A WALLOPING… *Looks at theater and cries* How am I gonna fix this?

His phone rings.

Ash: yello?

Sophie: Hi, is this Ash Wellington?

Ash: myes. Who's this?

Sophie: I'm Sophie, I was watching your show and noticed my brother was causing chaos and wanted to know where yall are at so I can pick him up. I'm sooo sorry he ruined your show!!

Ash: *Looks at troy* ya brother, huh? Well aright then, we're in Dublin, Ireland, so it might take a few days to get here, but I do appreciate the apology. How'd ya get my number anyway?

Sophie: you put your number on one of your ads.

Ash: Oh. Rookie mistake am I right? Well, I'll keep the kid in check while you get here. Enjoy the rest of my show!

Sophie: Oh actually I'm here right now.

Ash: Wait, you- *gets tapped on back and sees sophie* HOW DID YOU-

Sophie: It's just Oakland logic, don't question it.

Ash: What's an Oakland?

Sophie: It's a town with magic and fun!

Ash: Well here's ya brat. *gives Troy*

Troy creams

Sophie: You are in big trouble, young man! Your coming home with me THIS INSTANT!

Suddenly, there is a big crash sound and there is a tsunami. Sophie creates a magic barrier that blocks it from hitting them but it destroys the theater again. There is a giant sea monster terrorizing the city

Ash: NOT AGAIN!!!

Sea Monster: COWER IN FEAR, AS I HAVE AWOKEN!!!

Troy creams again

Sophie: Oh no! We have to stop it!

Ash: *Crying in the corner*

Sophie uses her magic and fights the monster. She uses a calming spell to stun it and shrink it to a smaller size.

Sophie: Hey! Why are you attacking this city?

Sea Monster: uh… I don't know… they are so loud.. I can't take it.. *cries an entire lake*

Sophie: how about you come on down to Oakland! It's very "quiet" and safe there! What's your name anyway?

Mariana: *sniff* Mariana… I live in the Mariana trench, that's why I'm called that. I have super good hearing, so I have very    hearing.

Sophie: I see. What if I can fix your hearing?

Mariana: how will you do that?

Sophie: *does another magic thing that Shrinks her ears a bit* there! How do I sound?

Mariana: b-better. Thank you human. Now where is this Oakland?

Sophie: Follow me!

Ash: but what about my theater?!

Sophie: you can come build it at Oakland too! It's super safe!! (Nuh uh)

Ash: fine then. Lemme go say bye to my mother. *Calls mother and says bye* aight, let's go.

They go to Oakland and Ash rebuilds the theater and Sophie creates a giant lake for Mariana to stay in. Everyone is crazy about Ash being in Oakland and are all like EEEEEEE!

Sophie decides to teach Troy how to swim, so she takes him to the squid pool.

Sophie: Ok Troy. Today, I am gonna teach you how to swim.

Troy: NO I DON'T WANNA SWIM!! WATER IS SCAWY

Sophie: If you want to be normal again, you're going to learn. Now get in the pool.

Troy: NO

Sophie throws Troy in the squid pool.

Troy: WAAAAAAAAAAAA *  ing*

YA: IM CWOMING BWOO *saves Troy*

Sophie: See? Even YA can swim.

Troy: WAAAAA *YA gives him a pacifier and huggies and he COOS*

Later…

Troy and YA are taking a walk and stuff.

YA: Why dwont you wike swimming?

Troy: it's scawy

YA: Why dwont I tweach you?

Troy: *Shakes head*

YA: I'll give huggies after.

Troy: Owkay

They go to that lake Sophie made a few days ago.

YA: Okay so we're going to learn how to swim. *steps in water* Easy! Now you try! First get a swimsuit.

*Troy gets a strawberry milk bottle*

YA: Troy that's a Strawberry milk bottle.

Troy: Yes!

YA: you need a swimsuit.

Troy: Yes.

*After reference*

YA: GET IN THE LAKE!

Troy: NWO! IWM GWONNA DWRON!

YA: GET IN THE LAKE! OR ELSE NO HUGGIES!

Troy: FWINE!

*Troy gets in the lake but starts to   *

YA: OWH NWO!

*a mysterious creature grabs Troy and drags him down to the bottom of the lake. It forms an air bubble around his head so he can breathe underwater. It takes him to a castle under the lake. Troy wakes up later*

Troy: Wh-ehewe am I?

Mariana: Hello child. You are in my castle. I found you swimming in my home. Explain yourself at once.

Troy: *Troy seems attracted to her* uhh so I uh was trying to uh swim and I   ed. Uhh sorry!

Mariana: You don't know how to swim? *loud laughter* Everyone can swim, hun! There has to be another reasonable excuse for your intrusion.

Troy: Nope. I can't swim.

Mariana: hm.. that does appear to be an issue. You won't be able to return to shore until you learn, and I'm going to teach you. Come with me. Oh wait, you can't swim. *Grabs Troy with her tentacle*

She takes him to a bigger room.

Mariana: This is where you will learn the basics of swimming. Let's start simple, Can you doggie paddle? What even is a dog anyway?

Troy: I don't know how to doggie paddle. I don't know how to swim.

Mariana: Ugh, you're difficult. Just flail your arms around!

*Troy tries and fails to doggie paddle*

Mariana: This is going to take a while.

*learning montage*

Mariana: Alright, kid. I've given you all the time I can spare. Show me you actually have some sort of swimming knowledge now.

Troy: *does the doggie paddle, but also knows the simple swimming s  s*

Mariana: About time you learned something. I also noticed, why is it that you scream at everything? It is really irritating.

Troy: I have everythingphobia… fear of everything.

Mariana: that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. You are a strange human.

Troy: it's weal tho!! *Sees fish and screams*

Mariana: *Sighs* do you not want this "everythingphobia" anymore?

Troy: I don't want it anymore!! I can't take it!! It's tearing me apart!! Why must Sophie make me suffer?!

Mariana: Who's that?

Troy: she's my sister… she forced me to have the phobia by injecting fears into me.. she's crazy.

Mariana: is she the scientist lady?

Troy: *nods*

Mariana: I knew there was something off about that woman. It may sound weird, but I might be able to help you with this phobia of yours. Follow me.

She takes him to what looks like a medical room/spa room.

Troy: NO NOT NEEDLES!!! NO NO NO!

Mariana: I'm not sticking you with needles. You're going to get ocean therapy. It's a therapy where you lay in a bath with salt water and you relax your senses with very nice smells. I have a special magic that could get the liquid fears which I don't even know how you liquidize fears but I'll trust him flowing out of your  stream and perhaps you'll return to whatever your normal self was.

Troy: weally?

Mariana: yes. Now get in. Lay in the water and take a deep breath. It will begin shortly.

He lays in the water and he floats to the top because science stuff I don't want to explain. He smells the most amazing smells his senses could ever experience and she does her magic on him. (She is an ancient sea monster with divine powers). He feels super calm again and he feels super warm despite being in water. He is back to his normal self.

Troy: Wow.. it worked. I'm not scared anymore!!

Mariana: I'm glad it helped.

Troy: *in love with her* can- can I stay here? I don't wanna be turned into a kid again by Sophie if she sees me normal.

Mariana: Unfortunately, no. I do not feel like raising a human underwater. Besides, a human is not supposed to be down here for too long. At least be satisfied that you are one of the only humans that has ever received my mercy or kindness in that matter. Go home now. Your friend is worried about you. Goodbye. *the bubble in Troy's head floats him back to the edge of the lake*

Sophie sees Troy.

Sophie: TROY GERTHERD! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? YOU HAD ME WORRIED SICK!

Troy: oh no, Act not normal . If she finds out I'm normal she's going to turn me into a kid! I WEARNED HOW TO SWIM BWUT I WAS TWAPPED UNDERWATWER!

Sophie: OH. Who's idea was it to take you swimming?

Troy: YA!

Sophie: YA!!!!!!! GET YOUR BUTT OVER HERE NOW!

YA: Cwoming… *Goes to Sophie*

Sophie: Y DID YOU TRY TO MAKE TROY SWIM? YOU KNOW HE CAN'T!

YA: I wanted two help hwim.

Sophie: OH NO YOU DON'T MISTER! YOU ARE GROUNDED FOR A WEEK! NOW GO TO YOUR ROOM NOW!

YA: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

*Troy sneaks behind Sophie*

Troy: NO! I AM NOT DEALING WITH YOUR CRAP ANYMORE SOPHIE! *Pushes Sophie down and Sophie gets back up*

Sophie: I THOUGHT YOU WERE SCARED OF EVERYTHING! HOW DID YOU BECOME NORMAL?

Troy: I'M DONE WITH THE RESETS! I'M DONE WITH THESE GAMES! HOW LONG MUST YOU   US FOR?

Sophie: FOREVER!

*Gracie is back in Oakland and she sees Sophie and knows exactly what she's doing.*

Gracie: SOPHIEEEEEEEEEE!!! *Angrily stomping to Sophie* WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO YA AND TROY? And how do I suddenly remember everything?

Sophie: WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

Gracie: I'M GONNA USE MY ANIME POWERS ON YOU!!!! *Gracie lights up and gets all buff and has anime powers somehow. Gracie blasts the Oakland force field and at Sophie's magic and destroys it all. She also ends up destroying her powers in the process*

Now Oakland is without the uh weirdness. Sophie is powerless and her memory of going to magic school and learning magic are erased and Sophie's obsession/Insanity is erased. Mariana is hearing all of this and is not very happy.

Mariana: WOULD YOU SHUT UP?! PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SLEEP! *Goes back underwater*

Sophie: Oh ok. Uh hey Troy, What were we doing again?

Troy: I was going to run away from you.

Sophie: Why?

Troy: Because you're insane.

Sophie: Huh? What do you mean?

Troy: I KNOW HOW THIS ENDS, DON'T PLAY DUMB!!!

Sophie: What do you mean? I'm not playing dumb at all!

*To be continued with new arc*

Usual Patrick Star show intro

Patrick: HEY GUYS!! TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY! LETS SEE WHAT SURPRISE MY FAMILY HAS FOR ME!! *Patrick laughing sounds*

Camera moves to the parents.

They drive there and register him in

Cecil: Now, we will be right back! We are gonna get your special present, stay there!

Patrick: Ok!!

*They don't come back*

Patrick is too stupid to know why, so he does not care. He annoys everyone in the adoption center and meets his pet rocky. Soon enough, he sees some people come into the center. Their troubled daughter, Sam, is looking around for a brother, while slamming them all to the ground when she does not like them. She sees patrick.

Patrick: Hi there!! Im patrick!!!

Sam: *young Sam voice* I am sam.

They surf but sister sam falls off and patrick loses her

Patrick: SAM NOOOOO!

A few years later…

Margie: That’s it patrick. We've had enough of your shenanigans and this “Show” you keep doing. We are kicking you out.

Herb: You are gonna learn to live on your own, mister.

Patrick: WHAT? WHERE WILL I GO?

Herb: Somewhere far away from here.

Patrick: BUT I WANNA STAY HERE!

Herb: I'm sorry but no. Your sister will visit you still.

Patrick: OK FINE. I'll go live somewhere else.

*Patrick travels to Bikini bottom*

Patrick sees a big rock and steals it. He happens to meet SpongeBob and they become neighbors.

SpongeBob: HEY SQUIDWARD! GUESS WHAT? ME AND PATRICK ARE NEIGHBORS! BALALALALALALALALALLALA!

Squidward: OH NO, THERE'S TWO OF THEM?

Patrick: Hey Squidward!

Patrick: *sits in the back of the class.*

*Patrick shoots a spit ball at one of the students*

Student 1: HEY! WHY'D YOU THROW THAT AT ME?

Patrick: I'm bored! I don't like this class! It's   friendooooooring!

Teacher: PATRICK! THAT'S ENOUGH! OUT OF MY CLASS AT ONCE!

*Patrick gets angry and throws stuff around*

Teacher: THAT'S IT! GO TO SPECIAL CLASS!

*Patrick is angry*

Patrick: NO!

*Patrick is kicked out of the classroom and is launched directly into the special ed class*

Patrick: *Hits head on   friendkshelf* Ouch! My head… Where am I?

*Patrick looks around his surroundings and sees he's in special ed class*

Patrick's brain was plugged in.

Patrick: Why am I in special education class?

Special ed teacher: Because You're an idiot.

Patrick: Nonsense, My vocabulary is infinitely expanding! How could I be stuck in a special ed class? I have a 1000 IQ!

Special ed teacher: Huh? You definitely don't belong here!

*Patrick graduates school and enters a scientist lab.*

Patrick: *Experimenting. The machine starts to overheat and explodes.* DEAR NEPTUNE! WHAT IS HAPPENING? THE LAB HAS EXPLODED! I'm… I'm too smart. I must erase all my knowledge and power to save this world from further destruction.

*Patrick notices a dumb ray. He immediately shoots himself with it and goes back to his rock.*

*That's when SpongeBob SquarePants begins with the first season 1 episode.*

Gracie: *Wakes up and goes to a pet store. Buys a giant tarantula. I then buy some spider food. After buying the spider, I go to Red's pizzeria and enter it with the spider* Hey Red! Guess what I got at the pet store?

Red: *Turns around* Gracie, What do you want?

Gracie: Look at the kitty cat I bought from the pet store! Isn't he cute?

Red: *Sarcastic voice* Adorable. Why don't you go show someone else your "kitty cat" and leave me to my work. I have a pizzeria to run here!

Gracie: Okay! *heading towards the goofy fellers diner. Enters with the tarantula on my hands. I'm petting it and somehow the tarantula is mimicking a purring noise from a cat* HEY KURTIS! LOOK AT THE KITTY CAT I BOUGHT FROM THE PET STORE!  (Cleetus is in kentucky)

*Kurtis sees the spider and screams. Everyone in the diner screams*

Customer 1:    IT!!!

YA: I GOT THIS! *Grabs a mallet* COME HERE, SPIDER!

Gracie: *Gasps* NO! DON'T    MY KITTY CAT!

Kurtis: GETS OUTS OF THE DINER! SPIDERS AREN'T ALLOWEDS.

Gracie: I WILL!

*Gracie leaves the diner and is protecting the spider. The spider is hiding in Gracie's hair*

Gracie: Aww, Come on out, Kitty! It's ok. I'll make sure nobody   s you…

*The spider jumps onto Gracie's hand and purrs. How does it even purr? It's a SPIDER.*

*Gracie gets an idea and she sneaks into Snowie's lab. When Snowie sees the spider, She screams and is about to hit it.*

Gracie: NO! DON'T    HIM! HE'S FRIENDLY!

*Snowie looks at the spider and the spider looks at Snowie with puppy eyes*

*Snowie puts down the shovel*

Snowie: Sorry. I don't like spiders. Anyways, Why did you come here, Gracie?

Gracie: I need a lab with science stuff. Sophie's lab only has inventions and not science stuff like test tubes and chemicals and stuff.

Snowie: Well what do you need the lab for?

Gracie: EVERYONE WANTS TO    MY CUTE KITTY CAT!

Snowie: Well he's a spider and he's yucky!

Gracie: HE'S NOT YUCKY! HE'S MY FRIEND AND I LIKE HIM! AND HE'S NOT A SPIDER! HE'S A KITTY! Wanna hear him purr?

*The spider purrs while Gracie pets him*

Snowie: Ok I will admit, That is pretty cute. But wait, How does he purr if he's a spider?

Gracie: HE'S A KITTY!

Snowie: Ok then. Not going to question the weird logic. So you want to make this "kitty" immortal, Huh?

Gracie: YES. AND I WANT TO PROVE THAT HE'S A GOOD KITTY!

Snowie: Well he's not a good kitty. He's a icky spider!!!!

Gracie: NO HE'S NOT! *Puts the spider on Snowie's shoulder. The spider crawls on Snowie and it is purring as it is warm in Snowie's hair.* Isn't he cute?

Snowie: AHHHHHHH! GET IT OFF! GET IT OFF! EEEEEEEWEEWWWWWWW!

*The spider crawls on Snowie's hand and licks Snowie.*

Snowie: *Starting to laugh* No! EEK! He's licking me! Haha, Stop!

Gracie: He likes you! See! I told you he's friendly!

*The spider jumps onto Gracie's hand*

Snowie: Well, He's definitely friendly and I will admit, His puppy eyes he made were cute… Just one question. Does he bite?

Gracie: No! He doesn't have fangs.

Snowie: Oh. So he's   hugless?

Gracie: Mhm! Isn't he adorable?

*The spider looks at Snowie with puppy eyes*

Snowie: *Sighs* Oh okay! I'll admit it, He's adorable!

Gracie: Yay! So can I make him immortal?

Snowie: Sure, Why not! You've proven to me that he is friendly so sure, Why not? Just don't give him fangs or anything!

Gracie: I won't! *Goes to the elevator and enters. Sees a bunch of buttons to 1000 floors and sees none of them are labeled. Opens the elevator doors and goes to Snowie* uh. Where's the lab?

Snowie: Oh, It's the 900th floor!

Gracie: Ok, Thanks!

*Gracie enters the elevator and presses 900 floor. She puts the spider on her shoulder.*

2 minutes later, They are at the 900th floor.

Gracie enters and sees a lot of science stuff.

Gracie: Good thing I went to college!

*Gracie puts the spider on the table. Gracie mixes a bunch of science chemical stuff together and is able to create an immortal potion and accidentally dumps a "strength potion" and "live forever" potion on the spider. She pours the immortal potion on the spider and then the spider becomes bigger and is now a big spider. The spider jumps on Gracie and purrs. It gestures to her to get on its back. Gracie does so and Gracie and the spider ride back down the elevator. Once they are down, They go to Snowie to show Snowie the spider. Little does Gracie know, She also kinda poured an evil potion on the spider so the spider may be a bit evil…*

Gracie: Hey Snowie! Look at my kitty!

*The spider kicks Snowie and Snowie is flung at a wall. The spider shoots venom at Snowie.*

Snowie; I THOUGHT HE WAS FRIENDLY!!!!! *Goes to wash off the venom and after I wash it off, I kick the spider and Gracie out my lab*

Gracie: Well that happened… What should we do now, Kitty?

*The spider doesn't seem to be evil towards Gracie as it knows Gracie is nice to it.*

*The spider enters the diner*

Gracie: Hey guys! Look at my kitty!

*Everyone grabs a weapon and is coming to the spider*

Gracie: NO! DON'T HURT IT!

*The spider shoots webs and everyone is now stuck on the wall.*

Gracie: Uh… Kitty? Why did you do that to everyone?

*The spider begins to speak in a evil   enemy voice. (The voice sounds like a English-Mexican accent. The spider is from Mexico.)*

Kitty: Senorita Gracie, They were trying to    me! They were trying to hurt our friendship! I had to do this to them!

Gracie: I think you're taking this a little too far… Are you okay? And I've never heard you speak, Kitty!

Kitty: I'm just getting my Vengeance, Senorita Gracie! I'm starting to think you're on their side… Why do you defend them?

Gracie: I'm not on anyone's side! I'm just trying to say maybe we should rethink about this and peacefully resolve this?

Kitty: NO. I WILL BE THE RULER OF THIS TOWN AND NOBODY CAN STOP ME! I WILL HAVE MY CONTROL OVER EVERYONE!

Gracie: NO! I WON'T LET YOU HURT ANYONE!

Kitty: I see how it is… I'LL    YOU NEXT THEN!

*Gracie runs to hide in the pizzeria*

Gracie is out of breath from running.

Gracie: Hey Red! I need your help! So uh I kinda messed up a little bit… I may need you to help me defeat an evil kitty cat! You know, The cat I had?

Red: The spider?

Gracie: No! My kitty! It's trying to take over Oakland!

Red: I can't do this anymore. *Leaves for a temporary vacation/hiatus and puts closed sign* (we'll see where he goes later)

*Gracie exits the pizzeria and notices Kurtis exiting the diner. Gracie runs to him.*

Gracie: KURTIS! I NEED YOUR HELP!

Kurtis: Whys you a  mes?

Gracie: NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ME CAUSE I'M "Annoying" SO YOU ARE MY ONLY HOPE TO HELP STOP A GIANT SPIDER FROM TAKING OVER OAKLAND!

Kurtis: A SPIDERS! UHH WHAT'S A SPIDERS?

*They go to the spider that is dancing on top of Romone's palace*

Romone: AHHHH! GET OFF MY PALACE! I DON'T LIKE SPIDERS!!!!

*Clammy sees the spider and attempts to bite it but the spider eats Clammy*

Clammy: CLAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMYYYY!!!!! *Sad Clammy noises*

Romone: NO! RIP CLAMMY! YOU WILL BE MISSED 2014-2023 YOU WILL BE MISSED!

Clammy: *Trying to speak some word other than Clammy* I AM FINE! I AM COMING OUT THE SPIDERS   mothe

*Clammy is spit out of the spiders   mothe*

Jasmine the dog appears

Jasmine: MY MAGICAL CLAMMY! HAHA! HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE A MAGICAL TATER, CLAMMY?

*Clammy pushes (he doesn't have arms so he can't really grab stuff) Romone's candy catapult*

Clammy: Please stand on the cata-polt. (He can't speak well so he says some things wrong)

Jasmine: Is this a trap?

Clammy: No. There's a noice bone on the cata-polt.

Jasmine: REALLY? OOOOO!

*Jasmine hops on the catapult and is flung back to wherever he came from*

Clammy: YAY! CLAMMY! *Eats the catapult as it is made of candy*

Romone: CLAMMY! STOP EATING MY CATAPULT!

Clammy: GIMME CAKE!

Romone: NO. HELP US DEFEAT THE SPIDER!

Clammy: then cake?

Romone: Fine.. yes.

Clammy: YAY!

Gracie and the gang enter the palace to think of a plan. The spider is eating it's way to the bottom of the palace.

Gracie: Ok guys. We don't have much time before the palace is completely gone and we are swallowed to bits. We need to think of a plan fast. Any ideas?

Kurtis: Hows about wes takes Oakland and pushes it somewhere elseums?

Kurtis: ALRIGHTS! LET'S DO THIS! PREPARES TO  SUM GIANTS SPIDERS!

Narrator: Welcome to Cooper story and Romone finds his mom arc.

*We do Cooper story*

Cooper the dog appears in Oakland. He is happy.

In Sophie's lab…

Sophie: YA! GET OVER HERE!

YA: WAA     milk.

Sophie: Okay YA. Come and get your strawberry milk.

Snowphie sees the flying dawg and realizes it's the dog she's been trying to catch for years.

*Sophie goes to get a giant dog catching robot*

N.B: Hello dog. Would you like some food?

Cooper: hmmmm… What kind?

NB: Dino nuggies.

Cooper: DINO NUGGIES!?!?! OK WHERE ARE DEY?

NB: Inside this net.

Cooper: YAYYYYYYY *flies into net*

Sophie: YAY I FINALLY CAUGHT THE DAWG!

Cooper: LEMME OUT!

Sophie: No! Time for some   hug and huggies!

*Y.C appears and takes Cooper out of Sophie's hands.*

Sophie: GIVE ME MY PUPPY BACK!

Y.C: HE'S NWOT YOUR DAWG!

*Sophie tackles Y.C and grabs Cooper*

Sophie: COME ON DAWGGIE! WE ARE GOING TO THE HAPPY ROOM!

Cooper: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

*Sophie takes Cooper to the happy room.*

*Y.C tries to follow but a robot picks him up and takes him to the kitchen and gives him a huggie.*

Y.C: AHHHHHHHH! I GOTTA SWAVE COOPER!

Robot: You aren't going anywhere.

Y.C: LET MWE GWOOOOOOOO!

*Robot does not let go and feeds Y.C chocolate  milk*

Y.C: YAAAAY CHOCOWATE  milk!!!!!!!

Robot: Good. Now continue drinking that chocolate  milk and watch some TV.

*Meanwhile with Sophie and Cooper*

Cooper: LET ME GO CRAZY LADY!

Sophie: No. You are going to stay with me and be my puppy!

*Somehow Troy is near the happy room hearing Cooper and Sophie. He decides to enter but as he is about to, Mark picks up Troy and takes him to the robot where Y.C is*

Troy: NOOOOOOOO!!!!!

*Tick exits his room and is going to the happy room to save Cooper. A robot tries grabbing him but Tick screams so loudly it makes the robot go away.*

*Sophie hears Tick and lets go of Cooper. She takes Tick into the happy room and Cooper runs out. Cooper goes to the kitchen and sees Y.C and Troy. Cooper bites the robot and drinks the chocolate milk. He puts YC and Troy on his back and rides them out of the lab.*

Troy: Yay!!!

Y.C: Where are we going, Cooper?

Cooper: Oh no we have to save other Hooman!

Cooper runs back to the lab and goes to the happy room. Cooper distracts Sophie by throwing a strawberry milk bottle at her. Sophie goes to drink and Tick hops on Cooper's back and they fly out the lab.

Next arc: Romone mom arc

*Another day in the palace. Romone is reading a candy cook   friendk about how to cook better.*

Romone: Hmm. How do I make the perfect cake? It's gotta be perfect!!!!

*Bamone comes downstairs and sees Romone hasn't slept in days cause he's trying to make the perfect cake.*

Bamone: Um. How long have you been working on that cake, Romone?

Romone: 3 days.

Bamone: Well I have good news, Romone! Valdor is coming to visit!

Romone: Okay!

Bamone: I have a question though. You have a dad but what about your mom?

Romone: Mom? What's a mom?

Bamone: It's the girl parent.

Romone: I thought we only had dads?

Bamone: No! We have moms!

Romone: I better ask Valdor then.

*Valdor arrives*

Valdor: Hey my son!

Romone: Hey Dad!

Valdor: What you up to?

Romone: I'm making a cake fest. But I have a question… Where's mom?

Valdor: *Pauses* Did you say "Mom"?

Romone: Yes. Where's mom?

Valdor: She's on vacation…

Romone: For the past 35 years?

Valdor: Uh huh.

Romone: Why didn't she say anything?

Valdor: Cause she forgot to.

Romone: Ok.

Bamone: But that doesn't make sense. How can she be on vacation for his whole life?

Romone: You're right. How can she be on vacation for my whole life?

Valdor: She's not on vacation, Ok? She's just… Gone.

Romone: SHE  D?

Valdor: No. She's lost on Planet X. We got separated after the explosion.

Romone: Then she must be in space? How is she not dead?

Valdor: Every Romonian can adapt to their surroundings. Your mother was able to survive a big explosion somehow because I saw her come out un  huged but she got sucked in a black hole. Now she's lost.

Romone: THEN WE GOTTA FIND HER!

Valdor: I don't know if we can. The blackhole is sure far away from Earth. We'd have to build a rocket ship just to get there in time.

Romone: I know two goofy people who can help. I just need to give them candy money.

Valdor: Well good luck finding her. I gotta go back to my house in Kansas. My candy bowling tournament starts in an hour.

*Valdor goes to his house*

Romone: Then I guess it's up to me!

*Romone goes to the goofy fellers diner.*

Romone: HEY CLEETUS, KURTIS. I NEED YOUR HELP!

Cleetus: Uhh what you needs?

Kurtis: YEUH WHATS YOUS NEEDS?

Romone: I need help building a rocket.

Cleetus: uhhhhhhhhhh a rockums? We neva builts a rockums befoe’ But we can tries. That’ll be uhhhhhhhhhhhh 5 millium buckums.

Romone: Ok! *Gives 5 million dollars worth of candy cash*

Cleetus: Thank yous! We gon’ builds it now. It might take a bits cause I have nose ideas what a rockum is.

*Romone listens to idiot friends for 10 hours and when he returns, the rocket is already built. It is almost as tall as Romone’s palace*

Romone: WHAT?!?!

Cleetus: We dids it! How you likes it?

Romone: I thought you didn’t know how to build a rocket!

Cleetus: I donts, I searched googums.

Romone: Its beautiful… *Gives cleetus and kurtis both a 1 million dollar tip along with their pay.

Cleetus: Aw yeauhs, we richums!

Kurtis: Whats we gons to buysum?

Cleetus: Uhhhhh I have nose ideas.

Kurtis: Me toos.



It is another boring day in Oakland and red is performing in a Christmas show at his pizzeria. This is the first time this place has had a show in months. They have just finished the show and everyone is cleaning up.


Cleetus: Thats was a nice showsum red! I loves the part when you said y'all!


Red: Thank you my friend.


Sophie: That was really a great show. Wait what? *someone handcuffs her* I guess I gotta go back to the asylum. See ya red!


They take Sophie away and Troy cries because he is all out of Strawberry milk.


Tick Slaps Troy because he's annoying and Troy starts to destroy the pizzeria. Red had enough and let out a high pitched roar that shook all of Oakland. He kicked everyone out and closed the restaurant.


One month later…


Sophie was finally free from the asylum and went back to her lab. Troy was forced to go to school. Let's see what happens there…


Troy: I DON'T WANNA GO TO SCHOOL


Tick: I DON'T CARE. GET IN THE BUS OR NO STRAWBERRY MILK.


Troy: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


Bus driver: Do we have a problem?


Tick: No no. I'm sorry, Troy has… issues. Let me just…


Tick throws Troy into the bus and the bus drives away. They soon arrive at school and Troy is kicked off the bus because he wouldn't stop screaming. He slowly inches closer to the school, afraid of what's gonna happen there. He eventually goes inside and is instantly greeted by the principal.


Mr Sanchez: why hello there! You're Troy, right? It is nice to finally meet you. My name is Mr Sanchez, and I'm the principal of the school. It is always a pleasure to meet a new student here at Oakland middle school. Let me guide you to your home room if you'd like.


Troy: O-Ok.


Troy follows the principal as they show Jim around. As he does that, kids look at him strangely and it freaks him out and hides.


Mr Sanchez: hey what's the matter?


Troy: th-those kids are staring at me!!


Mr sanchez: They are only staring because you are new. Do not worry about them. Let's go to your class.


A lot of useless stuff happen in between i'll just skip to when he gets home. Through the day, he got bullied and beat up multiple times and got detention for throwing chocolate milk everywhere because they didn't have strawberry milk. Troy cries in his pillow.


After school, A month passes and many crazy things start to happen. Firstly, The watcher reappears and enslaves people and lastly, Troy is kicked out of school for being too stupid. We now go to Cleetus talking to the watcher.


Cleetus: Uhhhhhhh Hey Mr weird floating guy, Where are wes?


The watcher : IT'S KYLE.


Cleetus: Uh. Mr. Keyhole… Uh-


The watcher : IT'S KYLE. "KUH EYE OL". SAY IT WITH ME.

*The watcher's effects weaken.*


Sophie : Keyhole, Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole.


Tick: Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole Keyhole.

Tick: WHEN I GET ANGRY, I'M STRONGER.


The watcher : Uh oh.


Tick: NOW CALL ME TUCKY AGAIN OR I'LL BEAT Y-


The watcher : *Resets Oakland.* Oh, I'm so scared!


Tick: *Appears back in my room and wakes up.* HEY! I'M GOING TO GET THAT WATCHER! I'LL BEAT HIM UP.


*The watcher appears*


The watcher : Wanna beat me? Nah. You can't beat me.


Tick: YOU MAY BE STRONG, BUT YOU ARE STILL HUMAN…


The watcher : Oh, I'm so scared!


Tick: FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN.


The watcher : Ok but only because you asked!


*The Watcher turns off his powers.*


The watcher : Alright Tucky. Let's fight.


Tick: MY NAME IS NOT TUCKY! *Beats up the watcher.*


The watcher : *Gets weaker.* NO! If I can't control people then… I GET WEAKER! AH! I'M GETTING WEAKER!


Tick: *Continues beating up the watcher. Everyone else joins in.*


The watcher : *My powers are now gone permanently.* I BETTER RESET THE WORLD - OH NO! I CAN'T RESEET THE WORLD!


*The watcher explodes and the border breaks. Everyone is finally free.*


Sophie : I'm free!


Tick: We're all freeeeeeee!

Troy was red


Dun dun dun… to be continued…

*There was a boy who was 13. There was also a girl who was 10. These two kids lived together. The boy would always get teased by the girl. One day, The boy became silent. He would avoid the girl completely. The boy was named Kyle and the girl was named Cecilia. Let's see what happens next!


*Present day*


Cecila: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Tries to find Kyle. I can't find him. I notice a note at the front door. It's from Kyle.* A note? Not again… Probably ANOTHER STUPID NOTE ABOUT WORK OR HOW HE'S "Sorry"... WHAT A PATHETIC DISGUSTING BROTHER I HAVE.


*The note reads "Hello, Ceceila. If you are reading this, Well, I'm leaving. I'm going to do what you told me to do! Jump off a bridge and  ! I'm going to never be around you again. I'm going to leave. You'll never see me again. Goodbye forever."*


Cecila : I don't give a crap if he's dead!


*Meanwhile with Kyle.*


Kyle: Well, Time to  …


*Someone notices Kyle about to jump. The person grabs Kyle and hugs him.*


Samantha: Sir, Please tell me, Why did you want to jump?


Kyle: My family doesn't care about me.


Samantha: But you are so young! You have so much to learn.


Kyle: Nobody gives a care about me.


Samantha: Well I "give a" care about you.


Kyle: Really?


Samantha: Yeah. How about I take you to my house? It's pretty close by to where we are!


Kyle: O-Okay.


*Samantha takes Kyle to his house.*


Samantha: Well, Here we are?


Kyle: WE ARE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD! Are you my neighbor?


Samantha: I guess so?


Kyle: My family lives here…


Samantha: Don't worry. I'll protect you from your family.


Kyle: Thank you.


*A few days later.*


Kyle: Hey Samantha?


Samantha: Yeah?


Kyle: You know that one show called the story series?


Samantha: Mhm, What about it?


Kyle: Can we try to revive it?


Samantha: Well I happen to know the creator so yeah!


Kyle: Ok!


*Meanwhile with Cecilia*


Cecila : I miss mom and dad… Now that Kyle is gone… I can't talk to anyone… I didn't mean to hurt him! I thought I was joking with him! Well, It's too late for me to apologize to Kyle since he's dead. *Cries* I miss Kyle!


*Cecila pulls herself together.*


Cecila : Maybe I'll go on a walk. That'll clear my head!


*Cecila walks out of her house. She decides to see what her neighbor is up to. Cecila knocks on the neighbor's door.*


Samantha: *Hears the knock.* Oh! I'll get it!


*Samantha answers the door. Kyle sees Cecilia and hides under his bed.*


Samantha: Hi! How can I help you, Neighbor?


Cecila : I want to talk about something…


Samantha: Have you been crying?


Cecila : Yeah. I miss my family…


Samantha: Come on in. I'll make you some Strawberry milk. Maybe my friend can cheer you up or something.


Cecila : That'd be nice.


*Cecila comes in Samantha's house and makes herself comfy.*


Samantha: I'll get you some Strawberry milk.


Cecila : Ok.


*Cecila looks around.* I really miss mom and dad…


*Kyle covers his ears.*


Kyle: Ugh. All she cared about was mom… I'm not listening to anything.


Cecila : I also cared about my brother, Kyle. He means the world to me.


Samantha: Sounds like you have a nice family.


Cecila : Yeah. I just miss them.


Samantha: You know, What's funny is I have a friend called Kyle!


Cecila : What. Take me to him!


Samantha: *Brings Cecilia into the guest bedroom.* He should be in here somewhere- *Sees Kyle under the bed and drags him out from under the bed.*


Kyle: *Tries to hold on but is lifted up and revealed to Cecilia.*


Cecila : It really is him… I thought he  d!


Samantha: Huh? What do you mean?


*Kyle runs out the room.*


Cecila : Great. He ran out of the room. Well, That Kyle is my brother.


Samantha: He told me some things about you…


Cecila : I know. I've been awful to him but I decided to become nicer and I wanted to apologize to him.


Samantha: That's good. Maybe you can invite him for dinner at your house?


Cecila : He'll just run off when he sees me.


Samantha: Oh. Maybe I can keep him still?


Cecila: He'll be scarred for life if he sees me. He'll think we're bullying him.


Samantha: Can we both hug him then?


Cecila : Maybe that'll work but I don't know if he'll be ok with that…


Samantha: Ok. Well, let's try it. I'll go in first.


*Kyle can overhear the conversation.*


*Samantha comes into Kyle's room.


Kyle: *Screams and runs around the room.*


Samantha: Kyle! It's okay! It's just me!


*Samantha grabs Kyle and hugs him. Cecila comes into the room and hugs Kyle.*


Kyle: *Screams and squirms around. Shaking violently.*


Samantha: Kyle! We're just trying to hug you! Please calm down!


Kyle: *Doesn't stop.*


Samantha: PLEASE CALM DOWN!


Cecila : I don't think he likes this…


Samantha: This clearly isn't working. *Lets Kyle free.*


Kyle: *Runs off. Goes under my bed.*


Cecila : I think I may have one other solution to our problem.


Kyle: What is it?


Cecila : There was this old show that Kyle used to watch called The Story Series. It ended a week ago. Maybe if we revive it then we can get some answers from the characters on what to do.


Samantha: Ok. *Turns on a TV* No way… It says here that somebody already revived the story series! I think I have a idea. Ok so hear me out. If we can replicate Sophie's magic staff, Then we could travel to Oakland through a portal and have Sophie fix Kyle, and thus, We'd be featured on a Story Series show!


Cecila : But the author clearly says that it ended!
Samantha: Let's go pay the author a visit…


*Samantha goes to Aaron's house.*


Samantha: Excuse me, Is this where the author of the story series lives?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Why yes it is! The name's Aaron. Aaron. J. Hebbler. I'm the writer and producer of the story series.


Samantha: Why did you end the series?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: LD took over my series. He possessed the watcher and now everyone in Oakland is unsafe. Everyone in Oakland is going cookoo crazy and my series is dying. If only I could have some executive producer for my show.


Samantha: Why don't I help?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Writing a story takes tons of work. You'd need hundreds of bottles of green tea and you'd need powerful music to be a able to write the stories that I write. Are you sure you want to do this?


Samantha: Teach me the way of the story series. Train me.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Ok. *Gets a carpet. Sets up the carpet and grabs some green tea bottles. Place 2 next to me and 2 on the other side of the carpet.* Sit down and drink your tea. Close your eyes and think of ideas.


Samantha: Ok. *Drinks green tea and thinks.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Think about your idea and write. You are now trained in the art of Story Series.


Samantha: *Bows to Aaron* Thank you, Sensei Aaron.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: No prob. Now write the story with me! We are going to continue this series!


*Meanwhile in the story series world.*


Lord Conner (LD): HAHAHA! YOU FOOLS! I NOW RULE OAKLAND! YOU CAN'T STOP ME! SURRENDER TO ME! YOUR PRECIOUS WATCHER IS GONE… I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REALLY THOUGHT THE WATCHER BRAINWASHED YOU! BY   ING HIM, YOU DESTROYED THIS BORDER AND NOW, I CAN FINALLY    EVERYONE IN THE WORLD- *Cage appears and locks Lord Conner in. The watcher comes out of the ground and is angry at LD.*


The Watcher : Haha! I am revived! Thanks Aaron!


Aaron (Story series version): No prob!


The watcher : NOBODY ENSLAVES MY PEOPLE! *Rebuilds the border and rebuilds the buildings. Rebuilds everything. Restores Oakland and its compassionate people. Revives Orbis and all the Oakland laws. Puts Red back in Cincinnati and turns Lord Conner into a child. Puts Lord Conner in a maximum security mental health hospital. Removes all the evilness and replaces it with good in every evil character. Revives everything magic. Restores Oakland completely. Restores the USB and magic   friendk. Restores Elese and all the older characters. Removes the glitches and bugs. Revives everything good and fixes everything.* Oakland is restored! Now my people, Have fun again and don't fall for Lord Conner's brainwashings. I never brainwashed anyone. Now go on, Have some fun all my children who are all children! You will no longer be hurt and its thanks to God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit and for Aaron. Thank you very much and goodnight, Oakland!


*It is now night in Oakland and all the children go to sleep.*


The watcher : *Watches over my mighty town. The protection of God is over this town.* Ah, What a great day. I'll go take care of Red later…


*We now go back to the other universe with Kyle and his friends and family.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: We did it! We saved Oakland! Now there can be a 5th generation of the story series! Thank you, Samantha! To show you my gratitude, I will make you a portal to Oakland where you shall live and be happy with all your friends and family. You shall be a child and live in peace and   hugony. Now go, Have fun in Oakland. But just note, It's night time there so be very quiet! Okay?


Samantha: Thanks for all your help!




*Samantha goes back to my house with Cecilia waiting there.*


Cecila: So, How'd it go?


Samantha: Pretty good!


Cecila: Can we go to Oakland?


Samantha: Yep! Just open the box and everyone will be in Oakland!


Cecila: Nice!


*Kyle hides under the bed.*


Samantha: The author will make us our own lab and it will be combined with Sophie's lab and Elese's lab to make one big lab! We just open the gift and we'll be teleported to Oakland. Just know it's night so we gotta be quiet.


Cecila: Oh, Ok!


*Samantha opens the box and the box does exactly what Samantha says.*


*Samantha is now in her own lab.*


*Kyle is hiding under a bed.*


*Sophie is in her lab and she notices a new lab. She opens the lab door and sees Samantha.*


Sophie : Hey new neighbors!


Samantha: Hi there!


*Kyle notices Sophie and passes out.*


Cecila: Hello. I'm Cecila and this is Samantha,


Samantha: Hiiiii!


Cecila: And Kyle who is hiding under the bed.


Sophie : Oh! He's just like Troy! Maybe in the morning, Those two kids can play.


Cecila: Certainly!


Sophie : Well, Imma hit the hay, We can fully meet each other tomorrow.


Cecila: Okay. Nighty night.


*Sophie Goes to her room and sleeps.*


Samantha: Alright Cecila, Goodnight.


Cecila: Night. *Turns off the lights.*


*Cecila goes to sleep.*


*Kyle sneaks out of the lab door and goes to Sophie's lab.*


*Troy sneaks out of his room and notices Kyle. Kyle notices Troy.*


Troy: Hi.


Kyle: Hi.


Kyle: What's your name?


Troy: Troy. What's yours?


Kyle: Kyle.


Troy: Did your sister torment you?


Kyle: Mhm.


Troy: Same.


*A magic hand is holding a flashlight. It hears a noise so it goes out of Sophie's room and goes down to the kitchen. The hand notices Kyle and Troy awake and the hand gets a Strawberry milk bottle.*


Troy: RUN!


Kyle: WHAT IS THAT THING?


Troy: It's Sophie's magic hands. They are making sure we have a good sleep and they make sure we are healthy. The hands think that we freak out that we are not healthy and happy do they feed us strawberry milk so we don't cry. They are really good but they kinda scare me. The hands are playing with us right now so we should probably run. You don't want the hands to make you laugh. Once they play, They make sure you are happy. I'm okay with it but i don't like it when the hands pet my head because it makes me cry but i love it when I am fed strawberry milk and healed.


Kyle: AH! I DON'T LIKE IT!


Troy: I'll protect you. *Hugs and holds onto Kyle gently. Making sure magic hands don't make Kyle scared.*


*The magic hand tries to touch Kyle.*


Troy: NO. MAGIC HAND, NO. KYLE IS NEW TO THIS. HE IS ACTUALLY SCARED OF YOU. PLEASE DON'T PLAY WITH HIM.


*The magic hand does a thumbs up and makes a special bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle and makes a normal strawberry milk bottle for Troy. The magic hand feeds the strawberry milk bottle to Troy and Troy grabs the bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle.*


Troy: I can feed the bottle to Kyle.


*The magic hand goes to the back of the room and watches.*


Troy: The magic hand is not near us anymore. Let me feed the strawberry milk to you and we'll   hug and sleep next to each other. I'll protect you.


Kyle: Okie.


*Kyle drinks the Strawberry milk and falls asleep. Troy also falls asleep and holds onto Kyle and hugs him. Kyle coos and Troy coos. The magic hand cleans up the magic strawberry milk bottle mess and puts a blanket over Troy and Kyle. The hand pars Troy and goes upstairs to the magic hands room and goes to sleep next to the other magic hands.*


*The next morning.*


Sophie : *Goes to the kitchen with the magic hands.* Aww! It looks like Kyle and Troy got along! Come on magic hands, Go eat your magic strawberry milk dust. I'm going to wake up Kyle and Troy.


Sophie : *Takes the blanket off Troy. Begins to hug Troy.*


Troy: *Wakes up and smiles* Hey Sophie!


Sophie : Hey Troy! Did you have a good sleep?


Troy: Yeah!


*Sophie is about to playfully wake up Kyle as well.*


Troy: Sophie. Remember the kid that became depressed when you played with him? You know how he hated it when you played with him?


Sophie : Yeah?


Troy: Do you want Kyle to have a heart attack? Kyle doesn't like being playfully waken up and he doesn't like playful people so please, Let me wake him up.


Sophie : Sorry. I didn't know that Kyle wasn't a playful kid. I'll let you wake him up.


*Troy hugs and holds and   hugs Kyle and wakes Kyle up.*


Kyle: *Wakes up and hugs Troy. Cries from a nightmare.*


Troy: *Feeds Strawberry milk to Kyle.* Shh, Shh. It's okay. What's wrong?


Kyle: Nightmare.


Troy: The nightmare is gone. I'm here for you.


Kyle: *Feels better.* Thankie!


Troy: No probbie!


*While Sophie and the others are carrying on their day, Let's see the magic hands morning routine!




*Morning routine.*


*The magic hands wake up and tickle Sophie. They playfully help her get ready and the magic hands go to the magic forest. They begin chasing each other and playing. An enemy approaches. Oh no! It's the evil magic hands! The magic hands fight the evil magic hands. The magic hands win and the evil magic hands become good magic hands and join Sophie's magic hand army. The magic hands go back to the lab and spend some time with the people in the lab then they spread all throughout Oakland and make others happy.*


*That is what the magic hands do everyday.*


*Back to Sophie. We now rejoin Sophie going to meet some of her old friends.*


Sophie : Hey guys! I missed you!


*Sophie takes her friends to the lab and she makes a room for them.*


*End of story. Story Series 5 coming soon.*

Tick (Pissed off): I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO I WANT? *Stares at Orbis' eyes.*


Orbis: I'm guessing you are still mad at me. I'm just gonna make you some Mac n cheese.*


Tick: *Gasps* MAC AND CHEESE? YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!


Orbis: Why does everyone just scream in my town? This town makes no sense.


Red: I know.


Orbis: Oh. Hi Red. I don't know how I didn't notice you. Anyways, Back to cooking!


*Orbis makes some Mac and cheese for Tick.*


Orbis: Here you go.


Tick: *Wolfs down the entire batch of Mac and cheese.* Thanks. *Runs back to my room with my Nintendo switch.*


Orbis: Now Luke, What do you want to eat?


Luke: I am not hungry.


Orbis: I can see through your stomach. You are hungry. Now eat.


Luke: Wait. What now?


Orbis: I can see through your stomach.


Luke: NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Orbis: No I'm not getting away from you. You need to eat. Now don't act like a Troy now…


Luke: Don't act like a Troy? Don't you call me a Troy!


Orbis: I can call you whatever you want.


Luke: Oh really? Wanna fight?


Orbis: I don't fight my fellow citizens.


Luke: FIGHT ME.


Orbis: No.


Luke: BEAT ME.


Orbis: No.


*Red looks at Luke*


Red: You remind me of Troy except you don't spray Strawberry milk on me and run around my pizzeria.


Luke: *Starts to throw a temper tantrum.*


Orbis: Stop it Luke. Don't make me do it…


*Luke doesn't stop.*


*Luke screams as Orbis scares Luke off.*


*Luke runs out of Ohio and runs to Louisiana. Red takes him there.*


Luke: Thanks Red.


*Red flies back to ohio.*


Luke: *I am angry at everyone.*


Young Aaron: IN LOUISIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA!


Luke: GRRR. SHUT UP. YOU ARE ANNOYING ME.


Young Aaron: Waaw! Why ywou mwean?


Luke: Sorry. I'm just angry at people.


Young Aaron: Oh. Iwt owk.


There is a strange force that flings Luke back. When he gets up young Aaron is nowhere to be found.


One week later…


Oakland has been pretty boring ever since Sophie disappeared and orbis took over.


*Luke wakes up in the enchanted magic forest and sees magic hands surrounding him.*


Luke: NO. I CAN'T BE HERE! AHHHHH! *Runs to Red's pizza.*


Luke: RED. I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE!


*Red answers the door.*


Red: How did you get back here from Louisiana?


Luke: I DON'T KNOW BUT I NEED HELP DESTROYING OAKLAND BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! I CAN'T TAKE THIS CONSTANT REPETITIVE LIFE. PLEASE STOP THIS  !


Red: You want to destroy Oakland and get rid of the magic and weirdness?


Luke: YES. PLEASE END THIS NEVER ENDING  !


Red: Ok. I'll help. But we need to come up with a plan…


*Epic plan making montage.*


Luke: Alright. Explain the plan to me again?


Red: Ok so we need to get rid of Orbis and Oakland's power. Since you are good at hacking you can distract Orbis while I    him and destroy his power of Oakland.


Luke: Ok. Let's do this.


*We now enter Red's pov*


Red: *Goes to Orbis's palace and sneaks in.*


*Orbis is watching Young Aaron.*


*Orbis doesn't notice Red.*


*Red snaps Orbis's neck and eats Orbis. Red then nukes Orbis's palace and powerplant.*


*Luke runs away from the explosion and meets Red at Soapbar's palace.*


Luke: I guess this is goodbye. Nah. JUST BLOW EVERYTHING UP!


Red: If you say so. Get on my back. I'll fly to safety.


Luke: K.


*Red flies Luke to safety. Luke watches Oakland get destroyed. Kurtis and Cleetus are with Luke. Romone and the Romanians+ King Aaron are also with Luke.*


*Red blows up Oakland.*


*A weird phenomenon happens where it seems that oakland reverts back to normal in a blink of an eye. It seems that there is something that prevents Oakland's destruction, but what could it be? Everyone is suddenly teleported back to Oakland and some strange border forms around the city. Everyone blacks out and their memories of this day happening were wiped. They all wake up back to where they were originally.*
Luke: *wakes up* huh.. What a weird dream. Wait a second… THAT WAS REAL! SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BRAINWASH ME!


*Luke goes to Red's.*


Luke: RED! I NEED YOUR HELP!


Red: I know. Oakland got resetted again.


Luke: HOW ARE YOU NOT AFFECTED?


Red: I'm a robot. I can't be affected by Oakland.


Luke: WHY DOESN'T THIS NIGHTMARE END???


Red: The only way to end this is to find the source…


Luke: Hmm. Maybe we can catch the thing that resets Oakland.


Red: And since the technology can't be affected, Maybe we could record the reset and see what is causing this.


Luke: Wow. That's actually not a bad idea!


Red: I've seen this happen many times… Where is Cleetus and the others?


Luke: Well, I don't know. Last time I saw them was when we were out of Oakland.


Red: So it seems like something is watching whatever the people do… Almost like a TV show where the director watches everything.


Luke: But this isn't a show. This is reality.


Red: We need to focus on the plan. Let's stop breaking the 4th wall.


Luke: K. So let's get a camera and you record the action since you can't be affected.


*Red gets a camera from somewhere and records Oakland.*


*Luke walks out of the border of Oakland and Oakland resets. Red caught the action on tape.*


Red: I got the recording- Oh right. Everytime Oakland resets, Every living thing is teleported back to the lab and/or their house.


*Luke runs out the lab. Magic hands chase him.*


Luke: RED! I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU. THE WATCHER. THAT'S THE GUY WHO IS CONTROLLING THIS. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS- IT'S UP TO YOU TO SAVE THE WORLD.


*The magic hands take Luke back to the lab and they treat him like a baby.*


Red: It's up to me, huh?


*Cleetus is heard screaming*


Red: Cleetus? Alright, Watcher. Reveal yourself to me. I want to have a chat.


*The watcher appears.*


The watcher : Hello there. My name is Kyle owner of Oakland. You can call me Kai. I see you have a question of how I run this town… AND THE WORLD!


Red: What have you done to Cleetus?


The Watcher: Oh nothing.


Red: TELL ME.


The watcher : Let's just say he's all tied up.


Red: STOP THIS AT ONCE.


The Watcher : Oh little Red , Soon you'll be just like everyone else. A child.


Red: NO.


The Watcher : Oh? Wanna fight for Oakland now? I'm stronger than everyone in this town. I can easily defeat you…


Red: Let's Play a game….


The Watcher : What kind of game?


Red: Oh you'll see… *Epic fighting montage*

*Red fights the watcher. Red is able to easily    the watcher.*


*The watcher is at 1% health*


Red: Now… Prepare to…  eEeEeEeEeEe…


*Red   s the watcher*


*The borders disappear. The magic hands let go of everyone.*


*Everyone is free to leave.*


*Luke leaves Oakland.*


Luke: I'M FREEEEEEEEEEE!


*All the ghost people rise from the grave and start chasing Troy out of Oakland.*


*Troy is officially in a new town. Luke is in a new town. Red stays in Oakland with Cleetus. All seems well.*




















*The watcher comes back to life.*


The watcher : Hahaha… that was my clone! You really think you could defeat me?


*The watcher brings everyone back to Oakland and puts the border back over Oakland.*


Luke: GRRRRRRRRRRRR!


The Watcher : Sorry Red but… *Kicks Red out of Oakland and puts a metal forcefield over Oakland.*


Luke: AHHHHH! WE ARE ALL HOPELESS! EVERYONE, RUN!!!!!


*Troy drinks his Strawberry milk and looks at the watcher. He just stares at the watcher.*


The watcher : Hello Troy! What are you doing?


Troy: Drinking my Strawberry milk!


The watcher : Well what if I gave you an unlimited supply of this stuff? All you gotta do is convince your friends to drink it and make sure to do what the magic hands do then you can have all the Strawberry milk you want!


Troy: So I just do what I do to Sam but i do it to everyone?


The watcher : Yes.


Troy: Okie! *I notice Luke and I run up to him.*


Troy: *Grabs Luke and force feeds him Strawberry milk then hugs him.* Hey Lukie!


Luke: *Tries to force Troy off of me but Troy doesn't stop. Starts to become sleepy and starts to become like Troy.*


Troy: Aww! Now onto my other fwiends!


*Troy turns everyone into a Troy and the watcher puts hypnosis helmets on everyone.*


The watcher : Repeat after me. I will not be evil. I will do what the watcher tells me to do.


*Meanwhile with Red.*


Red: *Tries to get in.* WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE PEOPLE IN THERE?


*Red sees everyone brainwashed.*


Red: What the- What the heck is happening?


The watcher : *Teleports Red into Oakland.* I'm glad you asked! I just made everyone like Troy!


Red: YOU BRAINWASHED AND HYPNOTIZED THESE… KIDS?


The watcher : I'm only protecting them…


Red: STOP BRAINWASHING THEM!


*To be continued…*


Narrator: Welcome to the newest Story Series episode.


Let's begin.


*In Oakland, There lives one boy who goes by the name of Duke. Duke was a child just like everyone else in Oakland but Duke had one fear. Angels! Everytime Duke saw a angel, Duke would scream and panic kinda like Troy except Duke was fearful of Angels only. Let's see how our story goes.*


*Let's begin.*


Duke: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Sees my pa.*


Duke: Hi Pa.


Duke's pa: Howdy, Duke!


*Duke eats breakfast.*


Duke: I'm going to see Orbis. Is that ok?


Duke's pa: Yeah. I don't mind.


*Duke goes to Orbis.*


Duke's pa: Now I'm alone…


Ghost : No you aren't!


Duke's pa: AH- Oh. Hello.


Ghost: My name is Trista!


Duke's pa: You are such a cute ghost! Wanna go move to the Bahamas and spend some time together?


Ghost: What about the kid?


Duke's pa: Sophie can take care of him.


Ghost: Works for me!


*Duke's pa and the ghost move to the Bahamas.*


*Meanwhile with Duke.*


*Duke is now at Orbis's palace.*


Duke: Hey Orbis.


Orbis: Hello Duke. What can I do for you?


Duke: Can I have a tour of Soapbar's lab?


Orbis: Yes you can. Is your dad around?


Duke: He left me for a ghost.


Orbis: Oh! So sad! Let me take you to Elese and she'll take care of you.


Duke: Okay!


*Orbis walks Duke to Elese's lab.*


*Orbis knocks on Elese's door to her lab.*


*Elese answers the door.*


Orbis: Hello Elese! This is a kid without a parent called Duke.


Elese: Aww! He's so cute! I think he'll be perfect here.


Orbis: Alright. Well, I'm going back to my place, Take care of Elese for me!


Elese: Ok!


Orbis: *Goes back to my place.*


Elese: Come on in, Duke!


*Duke comes in his house.*


Elese: Do you need anything, Duke?


Duke: No.


Elese: You look a bit tired, Duke. Are you okay?


Duke: Yeah. I haven't really slept much.


Elese: Why can't you sleep?


Duke: That is personal information I cannot disclose to you.


Elese: I understand. You don't have to tell me. I still do want you to sleep though.


Duke: But I don't want to sleep.


Elese: I have the perfect place for you to sleep.


Duke: Please not the basement..


Elese: NO! NEVER!  You are going to a comfortable sleeping room!


Duke: O-Okay.


*Elese takes Duke to a bedroom with a child Duke's age sleeping. Elese puts Duke next to the child.*


Elese: Hug the child.


Duke: Why?


Elese: The child is sad and I think you'll feel good when you hug him. *Turns off the lights and tucks Duke in. Makes Duke hug the child gently and closes the bedroom door.*


Duke: *Falls asleep and starts to panic as I'm dreaming.*


*The other child wakes up and sees Duke hugging. The child feels better but the child sees Duke panicking so the other kid hugs Duke and goes back to sleep.*


Duke (Dreaming): AHH! WHERE AM I?


*The other kid appears in Duke's dream.*


Duke (Dreaming): SOMEBODY HELP ME!


*The other kid taps on Duke*


Kale (Other kid): Hey, You ok?


Duke: NO! I'M NOT OK! MY BIGGEST FEARS ARE ALL AROUND ME! PWEASE HELP ME!


*Kale hugs Duke gently*


Kale: Shhhh. You were the one who hugged me while I was asleep, Now I'm going to return the favor to you.


Duke: Please pwotect me…


Kale: *Continues hugging.* I will.


Duke: Thank you…


Kale: No problem.


*An angel flies over to Duke.*


Duke: *Screams*


*The angel tries to hug Duke.*


Duke: *Screams and wakes up.*


Kale: *Wakes up and looks at Duke.*


Duke: Hey.


Kale: I'm going to protect you.


Duke: Thank you. *Hugs and kisses kale.*


*Elese comes into the room .*


Elese: Hey Duke and Kale- AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! YOU TWO ARE SO ADORABLE!


Duke: I'm hungry!


Elese: Well, Let's eat!


Kale: What are we eating?


Elese: What do you cuties want to eat.


Kale: Idk. Surprise us.


Elese: Okay!


*Elese makes the food.*


*After she makes the food.*


Elese: Alright kids, Dig in! I made you cuties some breakfast!


*Duke and Kale eat*


*After they eat*


Kale: I’m full.


Duke: Me too.


Elese: Well kids, I was thinking that today we could go somewhere fun! I was thinking we could go to a different dimension!


Kale: Sounds fun!


Duke: I’m down.


Elese: Alright! Now if I could just find my portal gun then we could- *Sees my magic portal gun* Aha! Found it! *I open a portal to the wrong dimension and I try to close the portal. Duke gets sucked into the portal and the portal closes.*


Kale: Oh no! Duke got sucked into the portal! What do we do?


Elese: I think the portal gun is broken. I’m going to fix it then we need to open the portal. For now though, Just chill out.


*Meanwhile with Duke*


*Duke gets up. He is now in a dimension full of nice, gentle and friendly angels with powers! Duke won’t like that…*


*Duke looks around. Duke is terrified.*


*A angel flies down to Duke.*


Angey: Hello! My name is Angey! You must be a small human child! What’s your name, Child?


Duke: AHHHH! NO! MY NIGHTMARES ARE REAL!!!!! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Angey: Hey! Are you-


*Duke starts to cry.*


Angey: Woah! Please don’t cry! It’s ok!


*All the angels see Duke crying and they fly over to Duke and hug him and play with him. The angels begin to comfort Duke and try to calm Duke down. Duke starts to turn red and Duke’s eyes go wide. The angels use their angel powers to do everything they can to help Duke but Duke is still mentally hurt.*


*One of the angels uses their mind healing powers to heal Duke’s mind. Duke starts to cry even more. The angels hug and   hug Duke and they begin to cry with Duke. Duke realizes these angels are not a threat and Duke calms down. Duke is then introduced to angel city and the angels protect Duke. They teach Duke about their leader, God and how they praise him and worship him. The angels introduce Duke to worship music and the angels take care of Duke.*


*Meanwhile, Elese and Kale have fixed the portal gun and they go into the dimension. They enter into the angel dimension and the angels all welcome Kale and Elese. Duke runs to Kale and hugs him. The angels wave goodbye to Duke and the others and the angels resume their normal activity.*


*Duke has a good life*


*End of story*
Hey guys, Young Aaron here. Today we are going to be talking about how we can improve the Young Aaron personality. If you don't know what Young Aaron is, He is a young version of modern day Tick. Tick decided to revive his young self because he enjoys his younger self but he wants to change his younger self to be better. Young Aaron is the official mascot of the Tick YouTube channel and Tick has decided to make a series about it. By the way, The T.G.O.G series will continue. I am not ending it. I'm just thinking of new episode ideas. Now, Without further Ado, Let's begin today's Young Aaron research. This is the first time I am researching but I hope it goes well. So, Let's start our research.


Alright guys. So the first step to building a better Young me is to eliminate evil and replace it with good and   the kid with Compassion and kindness. That way, It'll make young Aaron less of an evil kid and more of a nicer kid! We also should eliminate bullying as bullying is not allowed on my channel. We also need to make sure Young Aaron's character is respectful, Kid-like and innocent but not hurtful or mean to others. We need to make sure Young Aaron can help others be Christian and that is do what I plan to do. I plan to make everyone better persons and Christians. Now that we got all the big important info out of the way, Let's talk about what videos I will be making! So I will be making some very respectful videos that teach people lessons. I will also be making some narrations, I'll be doing many different things just like Tick! I'll also be helping you guys out AND I'LL BE DOING LIVE STREAMS! IT'LL BE SO FUN! My streams will be very different from Tick's streams though. So, What other things will I be talking about in this research? Nothing. I've run out of ideas for this research. (WHY DO I PLAY AMERICAN IDOL? I DON'T WAAAAAANA PLAY IT ANYMORE DO LET'S HIDE IN THE OLD DAYS AND PLAY AMERICAN IDOL WHILE DRINKING A CUP OF GREEN TEA. This will be spoken in a very dramatic and deep funny voice.)

I  PRESENT  TO YOU the one the only made by me
IN THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By: AARON
What people need to know is that i think i could spend time with my friends in the future because they care about me. for exzample i went a abanded arcade place that has animatronics that still work, also i enjoy playing the arcade there, my friends are also nice to me, and we have fun exploring i went to the ambaned pizza place for exzample they have a old maskout chuck e cheese, and the animatronic band is 101 lbs. I had to call a tow truck that could lift it. I will have to call the tow truck tommrow.
Since the animatronics are still at the pizza place i maby[c] i could haul the animatronics to my house. But the problem is i can`t haul the animatronic band in my mom`s car. So i will have to call a tow truck to tow today it can just pick up the broken parts and tow it to my house. I have solved the problem. So if you ever want a animatronic band just go to a abanded pizza place that has animatronics that still work un plug the animatronic, then call a tow truck, finley wait till the tow truck comes to your house then you will have a animatronic band.  I hope you enjoyed my document bye bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   Red and romone adventures full story
So one day at reds redthebear was hm….. Let's see here i think he was… oh i remember! He was kissing roxy. Also another day at romones he was feeding clammy but than clammy broke the wall of jawbreaker. So meanwhile at reds, red was still kissing roxy when suddenly the phone rang. Red answered it and romone said something. “Hey red how ya do- but… this is not what the story is about… this is about the war of video games... all of the video games in the universe went into war…… so another day at reds red was panicking because of the war and he was smashing the walls and tipping over the ball pit and all of the balls slid down stairs and scattered all over the place “red why are you going crazy?” “OMG CAN'T YOU SEE? THERE IS A WAR OUT THERE!!!” so meanwhile in romones clammy could not stop eating romone and romone accidentally   ed clammy and   ed lamone in his romone pack “ romone, you gotta stop doing this!!!! You're trashing the palace and we have a low amount of survivors because of you!!!!” “ WELL TO BAD YOU GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF DUMB AND STUPID CANDY WEAKLINGS!!!!!!” meanwhile at reds again red has calmed down and apologised and now he is fixing the walls and ball pit. “ hey red i know it is rough out there and i know it made you panic.” “ well i was thinking... remember that time when i stopped that nuke? You helped me! and if we survived that we can survive anything so let's go out there and show them whos boss!!!!” “ ya let's go!” so they went into the war and   ed tons of characters. Meanwhile at romones romone still was not calmed down yet. I WILL    you romone pack  ha ha ha ha ha! Any last words?” “romone your crazy ‘gets a gun and clammy eats it. “ HAHAHAHA   *threw acid at the romone pack.”  yes i   ed ramone because i blocked it and it bounced off at ramone HA HA i can't   BUT YOU CAN!!!   *clammy eats ramone pack* GOOD JOB CLAMMY SO YOUR NOT SO USELESS WHAT DID YOU SAY? Meanwhile at the war red and roxy were hiding from spring snap “ok maybe this was a bad idea was it roxy?” “yeah i guess… WAIT! You can use you're special powers together!!” “but how?” “believe.” “fine.” then red did his ultra power demon moves and said “may the black dove always carry you.” and all the video games got sucked back into their original games. Romone looked at the candy tv very bored and flipping through the channels, all of a sudden, the news flipped on and said “breaking news, the town of las vegas has been saved by redthebear once again!!” romone sighed as he said “i wish i could meet him, oh wait! I can I'LL JUST MAKE A PORTAL!!!” so he built a portal and turned it on waiting for red to go in it.

“The time I lied and regretted it...”
One exhausting summer day, Me, My mom Tatra, My sister Toti
and my sister’s friend Margy all met up and went to the park. My
mom Tatra said, “Now I am going to go for a walk with Margy’s
mom. Here are the rules... Rule 1. Don’t rough house or
anything. Rule 2. Do not leave the park unless we say you guys
can. Rule 3. Don’t go in the woods. Got it?” Then I said, “Yes
Mom. We got it.” Toti also said “Yes, we got it. We’ll follow the
rules...” Tatra, my mom said “Ok. Now you kids go do whatever
you kids do these days.” I said “Ok.” Then me and Toti went to
swing on the swings. 30 minutes later I decided to go see what
Margy was doing and Margy was on her cell phone googling
random things. A few minutes later, Margy decided to come to
us and she said this “ Hey guys. Wanna play tag?” I said sure.
Toti said “sure why not?” So we played tag for 1 hour and after
playing tag, Margy went to her original location and went on her
phone. Then Margy got off her cell phone and went to us, and
she asked both of us “Hey guys! Do you want to break a rule that
we aren’t supposed to break?” I said “Um. I don’t mean to be a
party pooper but... Don’t you think that is a bad idea? We might
get in trouble!” Margy said “Oh shut up! We won’t get caught if
we don’t tell them!” My sister Toti said “I’m down!” Margy said
“Come on Aaron! Let’s go to the woods! I promise they won’t find
out!” So I said “Ok as long as they don’t find out...” Oh but boy
was I wrong! So we went far into the woods that Tatra specifically
told us not to go into. Then after 40 minutes of playing in the
woods, We came out and Margy said “See? I told you our moms
won’t find out!” Tatra knew we were in the woods all along and
came up to us and said “Were you guys in those woods? I
thought I heard you guys there...” Margy said “this was all
Aaron’s idea! I had nothing to do with it!” Tatra said “You are in a
lot of trouble mister!” Then Margy’s mom took Margy home and
Tatra took us home. As soon as I came in the door of my house
Tatra said “I can’t believe you two would go in the woods! For
breaking my rules you both are grounded for one month!” I said “But Mom! I- I- I didn’t do it! It was Margy! Please! BELIEVE
ME!!!!” Tatra said “I have heard enough YOU ARE
GROUNDED!!!!” As I went into my room, I planned to prove my
innocence. So I came up with a plan. One month later when I got
ungrounded, We went to the park again but this time i got my
phone. So Margy went into the woods and she started bragging
about how she wasn’t going to be in trouble and that I was. The
whole time she said that, I was recording her. So after she
stopped bragging she said “What are you doing?” I said “Um...
Nothing?” I ran to Tatra and explained to her what happened, and
I showed Margy’s mom the video. Margy ran up to my mom and
said “Mrs. Tatra! It wasn’t me! I was framed!”
Her mom came up to her and said “It wasn’t you? Then why does
that video show proof? Are you lying?” Margy said “No! I was
framed!” Margy’s mom said “YOU FRAMED AARON!!! When we
get home you are in a lot of trouble Missy...”
Margy’s mom dragged Margy home.
Margy got grounded. My mom said “I’m sorry for blaming you...
you are a good kid and you’d never do this.” I said “It’s ok mom. I
understand. Margy’s mom called Tatra and apologized. Margy
got disciplined. Margy never went into those woods again.

*There was a boy who was 13. There was also a girl who was 10. These two kids lived together. The boy would always get teased by the girl. One day, The boy became silent. He would avoid the girl completely. The boy was named Kyle and the girl was named Cecilia. Let's see what happens next!


*Present day*


Cecila: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Tries to find Kyle. I can't find him. I notice a note at the front door. It's from Kyle.* A note? Not again… Probably ANOTHER STUPID NOTE ABOUT WORK OR HOW HE'S "Sorry"... WHAT A PATHETIC DISGUSTING BROTHER I HAVE.


*The note reads "Hello, Ceceila. If you are reading this, Well, I'm leaving. I'm going to do what you told me to do! Jump off a bridge and  ! I'm going to never be around you again. I'm going to leave. You'll never see me again. Goodbye forever."*


Cecila : I don't give a crap if he's dead!


*Meanwhile with Kyle.*


Kyle: Well, Time to  …


*Someone notices Kyle about to jump. The person grabs Kyle and hugs him.*


Samantha: Sir, Please tell me, Why did you want to jump?


Kyle: My family doesn't care about me.


Samantha: But you are so young! You have so much to learn.


Kyle: Nobody gives a care about me.


Samantha: Well I "give a" care about you.


Kyle: Really?


Samantha: Yeah. How about I take you to my house? It's pretty close by to where we are!


Kyle: O-Okay.


*Samantha takes Kyle to his house.*


Samantha: Well, Here we are?


Kyle: WE ARE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD! Are you my neighbor?


Samantha: I guess so?


Kyle: My family lives here…


Samantha: Don't worry. I'll protect you from your family.


Kyle: Thank you.


*A few days later.*


Kyle: Hey Samantha?


Samantha: Yeah?


Kyle: You know that one show called the story series?


Samantha: Mhm, What about it?


Kyle: Can we try to revive it?


Samantha: Well I happen to know the creator so yeah!


Kyle: Ok!


*Meanwhile with Cecilia*


Cecila : I miss mom and dad… Now that Kyle is gone… I can't talk to anyone… I didn't mean to hurt him! I thought I was joking with him! Well, It's too late for me to apologize to Kyle since he's dead. *Cries* I miss Kyle!


*Cecila pulls herself together.*


Cecila : Maybe I'll go on a walk. That'll clear my head!


*Cecila walks out of her house. She decides to see what her neighbor is up to. Cecila knocks on the neighbor's door.*


Samantha: *Hears the knock.* Oh! I'll get it!


*Samantha answers the door. Kyle sees Cecilia and hides under his bed.*


Samantha: Hi! How can I help you, Neighbor?


Cecila : I want to talk about something…


Samantha: Have you been crying?


Cecila : Yeah. I miss my family…


Samantha: Come on in. I'll make you some Strawberry milk. Maybe my friend can cheer you up or something.


Cecila : That'd be nice.


*Cecila comes in Samantha's house and makes herself comfy.*


Samantha: I'll get you some Strawberry milk.


Cecila : Ok.


*Cecila looks around.* I really miss mom and dad…


*Kyle covers his ears.*

Cecila : I also cared about my brother, Kyle. He means the world to me.


Samantha: Sounds like you have a nice family.


Cecila : Yeah. I just miss them.


Samantha: You know, What's funny is I have a friend called Kyle!


Cecila : What. Take me to him!


Samantha: *Brings Cecilia into the guest bedroom.* He should be in here somewhere- *Sees Kyle under the bed and drags him out from under the bed.*


Kyle: *Tries to hold on but is lifted up and revealed to Cecilia.*


Cecila : It really is him… I thought he  d!


Samantha: Huh? What do you mean?


*Kyle runs out the room.*


Cecila : Great. He ran out of the room. Well, That Kyle is my brother.


Samantha: He told me some things about you…


Cecila : I know. I've been awful to him but I decided to become nicer and I wanted to apologize to him.


Samantha: That's good. Maybe you can invite him for dinner at your house?


Cecila : He'll just run off when he sees me.


Samantha: Oh. Maybe I can keep him still?


Cecila: He'll be scarred for life if he sees me. He'll think we're bullying him.


Samantha: Can we both hug him then?

Samantha: PLEASE CALM DOWN!


Cecila : I don't think he likes this…


Samantha: This clearly isn't working. *Lets Kyle free.*


Kyle: *Runs off. Goes under my bed.*


Cecila : I think I may have one other solution to our problem.


Kyle: What is it?


Cecila : There was this old show that Kyle used to watch called The Story Series. It ended a week ago. Maybe if we revive it then we can get some answers from the characters on what to do.


Samantha: Ok. *Turns on a TV* No way… It says here that somebody already revived the story series! I think I have a idea. Ok so hear me out. If we can replicate Sophie's magic staff, Then we could travel to Oakland through a portal and have Sophie fix Kyle, and thus, We'd be featured on a Story Series show!


Cecila : But the author clearly says that it ended!
Samantha: Let's go pay the author a visit…


*Samantha goes to Aaron's house.*


Samantha: Excuse me, Is this where the author of the story series lives?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Why yes it is! The name's Aaron. Aaron. J. Hebbler. I'm the writer and producer of the story series.


Samantha: Why did you end the series?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: LD took over my series. He possessed the watcher and now everyone in Oakland is unsafe. Everyone in Oakland is going cookoo crazy and my series is dying. If only I could have some executive producer for my show.


Samantha: Why don't I help?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Writing a story takes tons of work. You'd need hundreds of bottles of green tea and you'd need powerful music to be a able to write the stories that I write. Are you sure you want to do this?


Samantha: Teach me the way of the story series. Train me.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Ok. *Gets a carpet. Sets up the carpet and grabs some green tea bottles. Place 2 next to me and 2 on the other side of the carpet.* Sit down and drink your tea. Close your eyes and think of ideas.


Samantha: Ok. *Drinks green tea and thinks.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Think about your idea and write. You are now trained in the art of Story Series.


Samantha: *Bows to Aaron* Thank you, Sensei Aaron.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: No prob. Now write the story with me! We are going to continue this series!


*Meanwhile in the story series world.*


Lord Conner (LD): HAHAHA! YOU FOOLS! I NOW RULE OAKLAND! YOU CAN'T STOP ME! SURRENDER TO ME! YOUR PRECIOUS WATCHER IS GONE… I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REALLY THOUGHT THE WATCHER BRAINWASHED YOU! BY   ING HIM, YOU DESTROYED THIS BORDER AND NOW, I CAN FINALLY    EVERYONE IN THE WORLD- *Cage appears and locks Lord Conner in. The watcher comes out of the ground and is angry at LD.*


The Watcher : Haha! I am revived! Thanks Aaron!


Aaron (Story series version): No prob!


The watcher : NOBODY ENSLAVES MY PEOPLE! *Rebuilds the border and rebuilds the buildings. Rebuilds everything. Restores Oakland and its compassionate people. Revives Orbis and all the Oakland laws. Puts Red back in Cincinnati and turns Lord Conner into a child. Puts Lord Conner in a maximum security mental health hospital. Removes all the evilness and replaces it with good in every evil character. Revives everything magic. Restores Oakland completely. Restores the USB and magic   friendk. Restores Elese and all the older characters. Removes the glitches and bugs. Revives everything good and fixes everything.* Oakland is restored!

You will no longer be hurt and its thanks to God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit and for Aaron. Thank you very much and goodnight, Oakland!


*It is now night in Oakland and all the children go to sleep.*


The watcher : *Watches over my mighty town. The protection of God is over this town.* Ah, What a great day. I'll go take care of Red later…


*We now go back to the other universe with Kyle and his friends and family.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: We did it! We saved Oakland! Now there can be a 5th generation of the story series! Thank you, Samantha! To show you my gratitude, I will make you a portal to Oakland where you shall live and be happy with all your friends and family. You shall be a child and live in peace and   hugony.

Troy: Hi.


Kyle: Hi.


Kyle: What's your name?


Troy: Troy. What's yours?


Kyle: Kyle.


Troy: Did your sister torment you?


Kyle: Mhm.


Troy: Same.


*A magic hand is holding a flashlight. It hears a noise so it goes out of Sophie's room and goes down to the kitchen. The hand notices Kyle and Troy awake and the hand gets a Strawberry milk bottle.*


Troy: RUN!


Kyle: WHAT IS THAT THING?


Troy: It's Sophie's magic hands. They are making sure we have a good sleep and they make sure we are healthy. The hands think that we freak out that we are not healthy and happy do they feed us strawberry milk so we don't cry. They are really good but they kinda scare me. The hands are playing with us right now so we should probably run. You don't want the hands to make you laugh. Once they play, They make sure you are happy. I'm okay with it but i don't like it when the hands pet my head because it makes me cry but i love it when I am fed strawberry milk and healed.


Kyle: AH! I DON'T LIKE IT!


Troy: I'll protect you. *Hugs and holds onto Kyle gently. Making sure magic hands don't make Kyle scared.*


*The magic hand tries to touch Kyle.*


Troy: NO. MAGIC HAND, NO. KYLE IS NEW TO THIS. HE IS ACTUALLY SCARED OF YOU. PLEASE DON'T PLAY WITH HIM.


*The magic hand does a thumbs up and makes a special bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle and makes a normal strawberry milk bottle for Troy. The magic hand feeds the strawberry milk bottle to Troy and Troy grabs the bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle.*


Troy: I can feed the bottle to Kyle.


*The magic hand goes to the back of the room and watches.*


Troy: The magic hand is not near us anymore. Let me feed the strawberry milk to you and we'll   hug and sleep next to each other. I'll protect you.


Kyle: Okie.


*Kyle drinks the Strawberry milk and falls asleep. Troy also falls asleep and holds onto Kyle and hugs him. Kyle coos and Troy coos. The magic hand cleans up the magic strawberry milk bottle mess and puts a blanket over Troy and Kyle. The hand pars Troy and goes upstairs to the magic hands room and goes to sleep next to the other magic hands.*


*The next morning.*


Sophie : *Goes to the kitchen with the magic hands.* Aww! It looks like Kyle and Troy got along! Come on magic hands, Go eat your magic strawberry milk dust. I'm going to wake up Kyle and Troy.


Sophie : *Takes the blanket off Troy. Begins to hug Troy.*


Troy: *Wakes up and smiles* Hey Sophie!


Sophie : Hey Troy! Did you have a good sleep?


Troy: Yeah!


*Sophie is about to playfully wake up Kyle as well.*


Troy: Sophie. Remember the kid that became depressed when you played with him? You know how he hated it when you played with him?


Sophie : Yeah?


Troy: Do you want Kyle to have a heart attack? Kyle doesn't like being playfully waken up and he doesn't like playful people so please, Let me wake him up.


Sophie : Sorry. I didn't know that Kyle wasn't a playful kid. I'll let you wake him up.


*Troy hugs and holds and   hugs Kyle and wakes Kyle up.*


Kyle: *Wakes up and hugs Troy. Cries from a nightmare.*


Troy: *Feeds Strawberry milk to Kyle.* Shh, Shh. It's okay. What's wrong?


Kyle: Nightmare.


Troy: The nightmare is gone. I'm here for you.

Orbis: You never learn, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO    YOU AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE!


Orbis: No you ain't. I'm much stronger than you. I'm the second strongest entity in this town. If you    me then you    everyone in this world. I'm not letting you destroy this town with your evil ways, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO    Y-


Orbis: Shut up. *puts Sophie to sleep.*


Sophie: N-


Orbis: That takes care of that.


*Orbis goes to the lab and sees what's going on.*

Orbis: I'm guessing you are still mad at me. I'm just gonna make you some Mac n cheese.*


Tick: *Gasps* MAC AND CHEESE? YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!

Luke: I am not hungry.


Orbis: I can see through your stomach. You are hungry. Now eat.


Luke: Wait. What now?


Orbis: I can see through your stomach.


Luke: NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Orbis: No I'm not getting away from you. You need to eat. Now don't act like a Troy now…


Luke: Don't act like a Troy? Don't you call me a Troy!


Orbis: I can call you whatever you want.


Luke: Oh really? Wanna fight?


Orbis: I don't fight my fellow citizens.


Luke: FIGHT ME.


Orbis: No.


Luke: BEAT ME.


Orbis: No.


*Red looks at Luke*


Red: You remind me of Troy except you don't spray Strawberry milk on me and run around my pizzeria.


Luke: *Starts to throw a temper tantrum.*


Orbis: Stop it Luke. Don't make me do it…


*Luke doesn't stop.*


*Luke screams as Orbis scares Luke off.*


*Luke runs out of Ohio and runs to Louisiana. Red takes him there.*


Luke: Thanks Red.


*Red flies back to ohio.*


Luke: *I am angry at everyone.*


Young Aaron: IN LOUISIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA!


Luke: GRRR. SHUT UP. YOU ARE ANNOYING ME.


Young Aaron: Waaw! Why ywou mwean?


Luke: Sorry. I'm just angry at people.


Young Aaron: Oh. Iwt owk.


There is a strange force that flings Luke back. When he gets up young Aaron is nowhere to be found.


One week later…


Oakland has been pretty boring ever since Sophie disappeared and orbis took over.


*Luke wakes up in the enchanted magic forest and sees magic hands surrounding him.*


Luke: NO. I CAN'T BE HERE! AHHHHH! *Runs to Red's pizza.*


Luke: RED. I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE!


*Red answers the door.*


Red: How did you get back here from Louisiana?


Luke: I DON'T KNOW BUT I NEED HELP DESTROYING OAKLAND BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! I CAN'T TAKE THIS CONSTANT REPETITIVE LIFE. PLEASE STOP THIS  !


Red: You want to destroy Oakland and get rid of the magic and weirdness?


Luke: YES. PLEASE END THIS NEVER ENDING  !


Red: Ok. I'll help. But we need to come up with a plan…


*Epic plan making montage.*


Luke: Alright. Explain the plan to me again?


Red: Ok so we need to get rid of Orbis and Oakland's power. Since you are good at hacking you can distract Orbis while I    him and destroy his power of Oakland.


Luke: Ok. Let's do this.


*We now enter Red's pov*


Red: *Goes to Orbis's palace and sneaks in.*


*Orbis is watching Young Aaron.*


*Orbis doesn't notice Red.*


*Red snaps Orbis's neck and eats Orbis. Red then nukes Orbis's palace and powerplant.*


*Luke runs away from the explosion and meets Red at Soapbar's palace.*


Luke: I guess this is goodbye. Nah. JUST BLOW EVERYTHING UP!


Red: If you say so. Get on my back. I'll fly to safety.


Luke: K.


*Red flies Luke to safety. Luke watches Oakland get destroyed. Kurtis and Cleetus are with Luke. Romone and the Romanians+ King Aaron are also with Luke.*


*Red blows up Oakland.*


*A weird phenomenon happens where it seems that oakland reverts back to normal in a blink of an eye. It seems that there is something that prevents Oakland's destruction, but what could it be? Everyone is suddenly teleported back to Oakland and some strange border forms around the city. Everyone blacks out and their memories of this day happening were wiped. They all wake up back to where they were originally.*
Luke: *wakes up* huh.. What a weird dream. Wait a second… THAT WAS REAL! SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BRAINWASH ME!


*Luke goes to Red's.*


Luke: RED! I NEED YOUR HELP!


Red: I know. Oakland got resetted again.


Luke: HOW ARE YOU NOT AFFECTED?


Red: I'm a robot. I can't be affected by Oakland.


Luke: WHY DOESN'T THIS NIGHTMARE END???


Red: The only way to end this is to find the source…


Luke: Hmm. Maybe we can catch the thing that resets Oakland.


Red: And since the technology can't be affected, Maybe we could record the reset and see what is causing this.


Luke: Wow. That's actually not a bad idea!


Red: I've seen this happen many times… Where is Cleetus and the others?


Luke: Well, I don't know. Last time I saw them was when we were out of Oakland.


Red: So it seems like something is watching whatever the people do… Almost like a TV show where the director watches everything.


Luke: But this isn't a show. This is reality.


Red: We need to focus on the plan. Let's stop breaking the 4th wall.


Luke: K. So let's get a camera and you record the action since you can't be affected.


*Red gets a camera from somewhere and records Oakland.*


*Luke walks out of the border of Oakland and Oakland resets. Red caught the action on tape.*


Red: I got the recording- Oh right. Everytime Oakland resets, Every living thing is teleported back to the lab and/or their house.


*Luke runs out the lab. Magic hands chase him.*


Luke: RED! I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU. THE WATCHER. THAT'S THE GUY WHO IS CONTROLLING THIS. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS- IT'S UP TO YOU TO SAVE THE WORLD.


*The magic hands take Luke back to the lab and they treat him like a baby.*


Red: It's up to me, huh?


*Cleetus is heard screaming*


Red: Cleetus? Alright, Watcher. Reveal yourself to me. I want to have a chat.


*The watcher appears.*


The watcher : Hello there. My name is Kyle owner of Oakland. You can call me Kai. I see you have a question of how I run this town… AND THE WORLD!


Red: What have you done to Cleetus?


The Watcher: Oh nothing.


Red: TELL ME.


The watcher : Let's just say he's all tied up.


Red: STOP THIS AT ONCE.


The Watcher : Oh little Red , Soon you'll be just like everyone else. A child.


Red: NO.


The Watcher : Oh? Wanna fight for Oakland now? I'm stronger than everyone in this town. I can easily defeat you…


Red: Let's Play a game….


The Watcher : What kind of game?


Red: Oh you'll see… *Epic fighting montage*

*Red fights the watcher. Red is able to easily    the watcher.*


*The watcher is at 1% health*


Red: Now… Prepare to…  eEeEeEeEeEe…


*Red   s the watcher*


*The borders disappear. The magic hands let go of everyone.*


*Everyone is free to leave.*


*Luke leaves Oakland.*


Luke: I'M FREEEEEEEEEEE!


*All the ghost people rise from the grave and start chasing Troy out of Oakland.*


*Troy is officially in a new town. Luke is in a new town. Red stays in Oakland with Cleetus. All seems well.*




















*The watcher comes back to life.*


The watcher : Hahaha… that was my clone! You really think you could defeat me?


*The watcher brings everyone back to Oakland and puts the border back over Oakland.*


Luke: GRRRRRRRRRRRR!


The Watcher : Sorry Red but… *Kicks Red out of Oakland and puts a metal forcefield over Oakland.*


Luke: AHHHHH! WE ARE ALL HOPELESS! EVERYONE, RUN!!!!!


*Troy drinks his Strawberry milk and looks at the watcher. He just stares at the watcher.*


The watcher : Hello Troy! What are you doing?


Troy: Drinking my Strawberry milk!


The watcher : Well what if I gave you an unlimited supply of this stuff? All you gotta do is convince your friends to drink it and make sure to do what the magic hands do then you can have all the Strawberry milk you want!


Troy: So I just do what I do to Sam but i do it to everyone?


The watcher : Yes.


Troy: Okie! *I notice Luke and I run up to him.*


Troy: *Grabs Luke and force feeds him Strawberry milk then hugs him.* Hey Lukie!


Luke: *Tries to force Troy off of me but Troy doesn't stop. Starts to become sleepy and starts to become like Troy.*


Troy: Aww! Now onto my other fwiends!


*Troy turns everyone into a Troy and the watcher puts hypnosis helmets on everyone.*


The watcher : Repeat after me. I will not be evil. I will do what the watcher tells me to do.


*Meanwhile with Red.*


Red: *Tries to get in.* WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE PEOPLE IN THERE?


*Red sees everyone brainwashed.*


Red: What the- What the heck is happening?


The watcher : *Teleports Red into Oakland.* I'm glad you asked! I just made everyone like Troy!


Red: YOU BRAINWASHED AND HYPNOTIZED THESE… KIDS?


The watcher : I'm only protecting them…


Red: STOP BRAINWASHING THEM!


*To be continued…*


Narrator: Welcome to the newest Story Series episode.


Let's begin.


*In Oakland, There lives one boy who goes by the name of Duke. Duke was a child just like everyone else in Oakland but Duke had one fear. Angels! Everytime Duke saw a angel, Duke would scream and panic kinda like Troy except Duke was fearful of Angels only. Let's see how our story goes.*


*Let's begin.*

Orbis: Yes you can. Is your dad around?


Duke: He left me for a ghost.


Orbis: Oh! So sad! Let me take you to Elese and she'll take care of you.


Duke: Okay!


*Orbis walks Duke to Elese's lab.*


*Orbis knocks on Elese's door to her lab.*


*Elese answers the door.*


Orbis: Hello Elese! This is a kid without a parent called Duke.


Elese: Aww! He's so cute! I think he'll be perfect here.


Orbis: Alright. Well, I'm going back to my place, Take care of Elese for me!


Elese: Ok!


Orbis: *Goes back to my place.*


Elese: Come on in, Duke!


*Duke comes in his house.*


Elese: Do you need anything, Duke?


Duke: No.


Elese: You look a bit tired, Duke. Are you okay?


Duke: Yeah. I haven't really slept much.


Elese: Why can't you sleep?


Duke: That is personal information I cannot disclose to you.


Elese: I understand. You don't have to tell me. I still do want you to sleep though.


Duke: But I don't want to sleep.


Elese: I have the perfect place for you to sleep.


Duke: Please not the basement..


Elese: NO! NEVER!  You are going to a comfortable sleeping room!


Duke: O-Okay.


*Elese takes Duke to a bedroom with a child Duke's age sleeping. Elese puts Duke next to the child.*


Elese: Hug the child.


Duke: Why?


Elese: The child is sad and I think you'll feel good when you hug him. *Turns off the lights and tucks Duke in. Makes Duke hug the child gently and closes the bedroom door.*


Duke: *Falls asleep and starts to panic as I'm dreaming.*


*The other child wakes up and sees Duke hugging. The child feels better but the child sees Duke panicking so the other kid hugs Duke and goes back to sleep.*


Duke (Dreaming): AHH! WHERE AM I?


*The other kid appears in Duke's dream.*


Duke (Dreaming): SOMEBODY HELP ME!


*The other kid taps on Duke*


Kale (Other kid): Hey, You ok?


Duke: NO! I'M NOT OK! MY BIGGEST FEARS ARE ALL AROUND ME! PWEASE HELP ME!

Duke: Please pwotect me…


Kale: *Continues hugging.* I will.


Duke: Thank you…


Kale: No problem.


*An angel flies over to Duke.*

*The angel tries to hug Duke.*


Duke: *Screams and wakes up.*


Kale: *Wakes up and looks at Duke.*


Duke: Hey.


Kale: I'm going to protect you.


Duke: Thank you. *Hugs and kisses kale.*

Elese: Hey Duke and Kale- AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! YOU TWO ARE SO ADORABLE!


Duke: I'm hungry!


Elese: Well, Let's eat!

Kale: Idk. Surprise us.


Elese: Okay!


*Elese makes the food.*


*After she makes the food.*


Elese: Alright kids, Dig in! I made you cuties some breakfast!


*Duke and Kale eat*


*After they eat*


Kale: I’m full.


Duke: Me too.


Elese: Well kids, I was thinking that today we could go somewhere fun! I was thinking we could go to a different dimension!


Kale: Sounds fun!


Duke: I’m down.


Elese: Alright! Now if I could just find my portal gun then we could- *Sees my magic portal gun* Aha! Found it! *I open a portal to the wrong dimension and I try to close the portal. Duke gets sucked into the portal and the portal closes.*


Kale: Oh no! Duke got sucked into the portal! What do we do?


Elese: I think the portal gun is broken. I’m going to fix it then we need to open the portal. For now though, Just chill out.


*Meanwhile with Duke*


*Duke gets up. He is now in a dimension full of nice, gentle and friendly angels with powers! Duke won’t like that…*


*Duke looks around. Duke is terrified.*


*A angel flies down to Duke.*


Angey: Hello! My name is Angey! You must be a small human child! What’s your name, Child?


Duke: AHHHH! NO! MY NIGHTMARES ARE REAL!!!!! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Angey: Hey! Are you-


*Duke starts to cry.*


Angey: Woah! Please don’t cry! It’s ok!


*All the angels see Duke crying and they fly over to Duke and hug him and play with him. The angels begin to comfort Duke and try to calm Duke down. Duke starts to turn red and Duke’s eyes go wide. The angels use their angel powers to do everything they can to help Duke but Duke is still mentally hurt.*


*One of the angels uses their mind healing powers to heal Duke’s mind. Duke starts to cry even more. The angels hug and   hug Duke and they begin to cry with Duke. Duke realizes these angels are not a threat and Duke calms down. Duke is then introduced to angel city and the angels protect Duke. They teach Duke about their leader, God and how they praise him and worship him. The angels introduce Duke to worship music and the angels take care of Duke.*


*Meanwhile, Elese and Kale have fixed the portal gun and they go into the dimension. They enter into the angel dimension and the angels all welcome Kale and Elese. Duke runs to Kale and hugs him. The angels wave goodbye to Duke and the others and the angels resume their normal activity.*


*Duke has a good life*


*End of story*
Hey guys, Young Aaron here. Today we are going to be talking about how we can improve the Young Aaron personality. If you don't know what Young Aaron is, He is a young version of modern day Tick. Tick decided to revive his young self because he enjoys his younger self but he wants to change his younger self to be better. Young Aaron is the official mascot of the Tick YouTube channel and Tick has decided to make a series about it. By the way, The T.G.O.G series will continue. I am not ending it. I'm just thinking of new episode ideas. Now, Without further Ado, Let's begin today's Young Aaron research. This is the first time I am researching but I hope it goes well. So, Let's start our research.


Alright guys. So the first step to building a better Young me is to eliminate evil and replace it with good and   the kid with Compassion and kindness. That way, It'll make young Aaron less of an evil kid and more of a nicer kid! We also should eliminate bullying as bullying is not allowed on my channel. We also need to make sure Young Aaron's character is respectful, Kid-like and innocent but not hurtful or mean to others. We need to make sure Young Aaron can help others be Christian and that is do what I plan to do. I plan to make everyone better persons and Christians. Now that we got all the big important info out of the way, Let's talk about what videos I will be making! So I will be making some very respectful videos that teach people lessons. I will also be making some narrations, I'll be doing many different things just like Tick! I'll also be helping you guys out AND I'LL BE DOING LIVE STREAMS! IT'LL BE SO FUN! My streams will be very different from Tick's streams though. So, What other things will I be talking about in this research? Nothing. I've run out of ideas for this research. (WHY DO I PLAY AMERICAN IDOL? I DON'T WAAAAAANA PLAY IT ANYMORE DO LET'S HIDE IN THE OLD DAYS AND PLAY AMERICAN IDOL WHILE DRINKING A CUP OF GREEN TEA. This will be spoken in a very dramatic and deep funny voice.)

I  PRESENT  TO YOU the one the only made by me
IN THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By: AARON
What people need to know is that i think i could spend time with my friends in the future because they care about me. for exzample i went a abanded arcade place that has animatronics that still work, also i enjoy playing the arcade there, my friends are also nice to me, and we have fun exploring i went to the ambaned pizza place for exzample they have a old maskout chuck e cheese, and the animatronic band is 101 lbs. I had to call a tow truck that could lift it. I will have to call the tow truck tommrow.
Since the animatronics are still at the pizza place i maby[c] i could haul the animatronics to my house. But the problem is i can`t haul the animatronic band in my mom`s car. So i will have to call a tow truck to tow today it can just pick up the broken parts and tow it to my house. I have solved the problem. So if you ever want a animatronic band just go to a abanded pizza place that has animatronics that still work un plug the animatronic, then call a tow truck, finley wait till the tow truck comes to your house then you will have a animatronic band.  I hope you enjoyed my document bye bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Red answered it and romone said something. “Hey red how ya do- but… this is not what the story is about… this is about the war of video games... all of the video games in the universe went into war…… so another day at reds red was panicking because of the war and he was smashing the walls and tipping over the ball pit and all of the balls slid down stairs and scattered all over the place “red why are you going crazy?” “OMG CAN'T YOU SEE? THERE IS A WAR OUT THERE!!!” so meanwhile in romones clammy could not stop eating romone and romone accidentally   ed clammy and   ed lamone in his romone pack “ romone, you gotta stop doing this!!!! You're trashing the palace and we have a low amount of survivors because of you!!!!” “ WELL TO BAD YOU GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF DUMB AND STUPID CANDY WEAKLINGS!!!!!!” meanwhile at reds again red has calmed down and apologised and now he is fixing the walls and ball pit. “ hey red i know it is rough out there and i know it made you panic.” “ well i was thinking... remember that time when i stopped that nuke? You helped me! and if we survived that we can survive anything so let's go out there and show them whos boss!!!!” “ ya let's go!” so they went into the war and   ed tons of characters. Meanwhile at romones romone still was not calmed down yet. I WILL    you romone pack  ha ha ha ha ha! Any last words?” “romone your crazy ‘gets a gun and clammy eats it. “ HAHAHAHA   *threw acid at the romone pack.”  yes i   ed ramone because i blocked it and it bounced off at ramone HA HA i can't   BUT YOU CAN!!!   *clammy eats ramone pack* GOOD JOB CLAMMY SO YOUR NOT SO USELESS WHAT DID YOU SAY? Meanwhile at the war red and roxy were hiding from spring snap “ok maybe this was a bad idea was it roxy?” “yeah i guess… WAIT! You can use you're special powers together!!” “but how?” “believe.” “fine.” then red did his ultra power demon moves and said “may the black dove always carry you.” and all the video games got sucked back into their original games. Romone looked at the candy tv very bored and flipping through the channels, all of a sudden, the news flipped on and said “breaking news, the town of las vegas has been saved by redthebear once again!!” romone sighed as he said “i wish i could meet him, oh wait! I can I'LL JUST MAKE A PORTAL!!!” so he built a portal and turned it on waiting for red to go in it.

“The time I lied and regretted it...”
One exhausting summer day, Me, My mom Tatra, My sister Toti
and my sister’s friend Margy all met up and went to the park. My
mom Tatra said, “Now I am going to go for a walk with Margy’s
mom. Here are the rules... Rule 1. Don’t rough house or
anything. Rule 2. Do not leave the park unless we say you guys
can. Rule 3. Don’t go in the woods. Got it?” Then I said, “Yes
Mom. We got it.” Toti also said “Yes, we got it. We’ll follow the
rules...” Tatra, my mom said “Ok. Now you kids go do whatever
you kids do these days.” I said “Ok.” Then me and Toti went to
swing on the swings. 30 minutes later I decided to go see what
Margy was doing and Margy was on her cell phone googling
random things. A few minutes later, Margy decided to come to
us and she said this “ Hey guys. Wanna play tag?” I said sure.
Toti said “sure why not?” So we played tag for 1 hour and after
playing tag, Margy went to her original location and went on her
phone. Then Margy got off her cell phone and went to us, and
she asked both of us “Hey guys! Do you want to break a rule that
we aren’t supposed to break?” I said “Um. I don’t mean to be a
party pooper but... Don’t you think that is a bad idea? We might
get in trouble!” Margy said “Oh shut up! We won’t get caught if
we don’t tell them!” My sister Toti said “I’m down!” Margy said
“Come on Aaron! Let’s go to the woods! I promise they won’t find
out!” So I said “Ok as long as they don’t find out...” Oh but boy
was I wrong! So we went far into the woods that Tatra specifically
told us not to go into. Then after 40 minutes of playing in the
woods, We came out and Margy said “See? I told you our moms
won’t find out!” Tatra knew we were in the woods all along and
came up to us and said “Were you guys in those woods? I
thought I heard you guys there...” Margy said “this was all
Aaron’s idea! I had nothing to do with it!” Tatra said “You are in a
lot of trouble mister!” Then Margy’s mom took Margy home and
Tatra took us home. As soon as I came in the door of my house
Tatra said “I can’t believe you two would go in the woods! For
breaking my rules you both are grounded for one month!” I said “But Mom! I- I- I didn’t do it! It was Margy! Please! BELIEVE
ME!!!!” Tatra said “I have heard enough YOU ARE
GROUNDED!!!!” As I went into my room, I planned to prove my
innocence. So I came up with a plan. One month later when I got
ungrounded, We went to the park again but this time i got my
phone. So Margy went into the woods and she started bragging
about how she wasn’t going to be in trouble and that I was. The
whole time she said that, I was recording her. So after she
stopped bragging she said “What are you doing?” I said “Um...
Nothing?” I ran to Tatra and explained to her what happened, and
I showed Margy’s mom the video. Margy ran up to my mom and
said “Mrs. Tatra! It wasn’t me! I was framed!”
Her mom came up to her and said “It wasn’t you? Then why does
that video show proof? Are you lying?” Margy said “No! I was
framed!” Margy’s mom said “YOU FRAMED AARON!!! When we
get home you are in a lot of trouble Missy...”
Margy’s mom dragged Margy home.
Margy got grounded. My mom said “I’m sorry for blaming you...
you are a good kid and you’d never do this.” I said “It’s ok mom. I
understand. Margy’s mom called Tatra and apologized. Margy
got disciplined. Margy never went into those woods again.

*Present day*


Cecila: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Tries to find Kyle. I can't find him. I notice a note at the front door. It's from Kyle.* A note? Not again… Probably ANOTHER STUPID NOTE ABOUT WORK OR HOW HE'S "Sorry"... WHAT A PATHETIC DISGUSTING BROTHER I HAVE.


*The note reads "Hello, Ceceila. If you are reading this, Well, I'm leaving. I'm going to do what you told me to do! Jump off a bridge and  ! I'm going to never be around you again. I'm going to leave. You'll never see me again. Goodbye forever."*


Cecila : I don't give a crap if he's dead!


*Meanwhile with Kyle.*


Kyle: Well, Time to  …


*Someone notices Kyle about to jump. The person grabs Kyle and hugs him.*


Samantha: Sir, Please tell me, Why did you want to jump?


Kyle: My family doesn't care about me.


Samantha: But you are so young! You have so much to learn.


Kyle: Nobody gives a care about me.


Samantha: Well I "give a" care about you.


Kyle: Really?


Samantha: Yeah. How about I take you to my house? It's pretty close by to where we are!


Kyle: O-Okay.

Samantha: Don't worry. I'll protect you from your family.


Kyle: Thank you.


*A few days later.*


Kyle: Hey Samantha?


Samantha: Yeah?


Kyle: You know that one show called the story series?


Samantha: Mhm, What about it?


Kyle: Can we try to revive it?


Samantha: Well I happen to know the creator so yeah!


Kyle: Ok!


*Meanwhile with Cecilia*


Cecila : I miss mom and dad… Now that Kyle is gone… I can't talk to anyone… I didn't mean to hurt him! I thought I was joking with him! Well, It's too late for me to apologize to Kyle since he's dead. *Cries* I miss Kyle!


*Cecila pulls herself together.*


Cecila : Maybe I'll go on a walk. That'll clear my head!


*Cecila walks out of her house. She decides to see what her neighbor is up to. Cecila knocks on the neighbor's door.*


Samantha: *Hears the knock.* Oh! I'll get it!


*Samantha answers the door. Kyle sees Cecilia and hides under his bed.*


Samantha: Hi! How can I help you, Neighbor?


Cecila : I want to talk about something…


Samantha: Have you been crying?


Cecila : Yeah. I miss my family…


Samantha: Come on in. I'll make you some Strawberry milk. Maybe my friend can cheer you up or something.


Cecila : That'd be nice.


*Cecila comes in Samantha's house and makes herself comfy.*


Samantha: I'll get you some Strawberry milk.


Cecila : Ok.


*Cecila looks around.* I really miss mom and dad…


*Kyle covers his ears.*


Kyle: Ugh. All she cared about was mom… I'm not listening to anything.


Cecila : I also cared about my brother, Kyle. He means the world to me.


Samantha: Sounds like you have a nice family.


Cecila : Yeah. I just miss them.


Samantha: You know, What's funny is I have a friend called Kyle!


Cecila : What. Take me to him!


Samantha: *Brings Cecilia into the guest bedroom.* He should be in here somewhere- *Sees Kyle under the bed and drags him out from under the bed.*


Kyle: *Tries to hold on but is lifted up and revealed to Cecilia.*


Cecila : It really is him… I thought he  d!


Samantha: Huh? What do you mean?


*Kyle runs out the room.*


Cecila : Great. He ran out of the room. Well, That Kyle is my brother.


Samantha: He told me some things about you…


Cecila : I know. I've been awful to him but I decided to become nicer and I wanted to apologize to him.


Samantha: That's good. Maybe you can invite him for dinner at your house?


Cecila : He'll just run off when he sees me.


Samantha: Oh. Maybe I can keep him still?


Cecila: He'll be scarred for life if he sees me. He'll think we're bullying him.


Samantha: Can we both hug him then?


Cecila : Maybe that'll work but I don't know if he'll be ok with that…


Samantha: Ok. Well, let's try it. I'll go in first.


*Kyle can overhear the conversation.*


*Samantha comes into Kyle's room.


Kyle: *Screams and runs around the room.*


Samantha: Kyle! It's okay! It's just me!


*Samantha grabs Kyle and hugs him. Cecila comes into the room and hugs Kyle.*


Kyle: *Screams and squirms around. Shaking violently.*


Samantha: Kyle! We're just trying to hug you! Please calm down!


Kyle: *Doesn't stop.*


Samantha: PLEASE CALM DOWN!


Cecila : I don't think he likes this…


Samantha: This clearly isn't working. *Lets Kyle free.*


Kyle: *Runs off. Goes under my bed.*


Cecila : I think I may have one other solution to our problem.


Kyle: What is it?


Cecila : There was this old show that Kyle used to watch called The Story Series. It ended a week ago. Maybe if we revive it then we can get some answers from the characters on what to do.


Samantha: Ok. *Turns on a TV* No way… It says here that somebody already revived the story series! I think I have a idea. Ok so hear me out. If we can replicate Sophie's magic staff, Then we could travel to Oakland through a portal and have Sophie fix Kyle, and thus, We'd be featured on a Story Series show!


Cecila : But the author clearly says that it ended!
Samantha: Let's go pay the author a visit…


*Samantha goes to Aaron's house.*


Samantha: Excuse me, Is this where the author of the story series lives?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Why yes it is! The name's Aaron. Aaron. J. Hebbler. I'm the writer and producer of the story series.


Samantha: Why did you end the series?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: LD took over my series. He possessed the watcher and now everyone in Oakland is unsafe. Everyone in Oakland is going cookoo crazy and my series is dying. If only I could have some executive producer for my show.


Samantha: Why don't I help?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Writing a story takes tons of work. You'd need hundreds of bottles of green tea and you'd need powerful music to be a able to write the stories that I write. Are you sure you want to do this?


Samantha: Teach me the way of the story series. Train me.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Ok. *Gets a carpet. Sets up the carpet and grabs some green tea bottles. Place 2 next to me and 2 on the other side of the carpet.* Sit down and drink your tea. Close your eyes and think of ideas.


Samantha: Ok. *Drinks green tea and thinks.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Think about your idea and write. You are now trained in the art of Story Series.


Samantha: *Bows to Aaron* Thank you, Sensei Aaron.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: No prob. Now write the story with me! We are going to continue this series!


*Meanwhile in the story series world.*


Lord Conner (LD): HAHAHA! YOU FOOLS! I NOW RULE OAKLAND! YOU CAN'T STOP ME! SURRENDER TO ME! YOUR PRECIOUS WATCHER IS GONE… I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REALLY THOUGHT THE WATCHER BRAINWASHED YOU! BY   ING HIM, YOU DESTROYED THIS BORDER AND NOW, I CAN FINALLY    EVERYONE IN THE WORLD- *Cage appears and locks Lord Conner in. The watcher comes out of the ground and is angry at LD.*


The Watcher : Haha! I am revived! Thanks Aaron!


Aaron (Story series version): No prob!


The watcher : NOBODY ENSLAVES MY PEOPLE! *Rebuilds the border and rebuilds the buildings. Rebuilds everything. Restores Oakland and its compassionate people. Revives Orbis and all the Oakland laws. Puts Red back in Cincinnati and turns Lord Conner into a child. Puts Lord Conner in a maximum security mental health hospital. Removes all the evilness and replaces it with good in every evil character. Revives everything magic. Restores Oakland completely. Restores the USB and magic   friendk. Restores Elese and all the older characters. Removes the glitches and bugs. Revives everything good and fixes everything.* Oakland is restored! Now my people, Have fun again and don't fall for Lord Conner's brainwashings. I never brainwashed anyone. Now go on, Have some fun all my children who are all children! You will no longer be hurt and its thanks to God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit and for Aaron. Thank you very much and goodnight, Oakland!


*It is now night in Oakland and all the children go to sleep.*


The watcher : *Watches over my mighty town. The protection of God is over this town.* Ah, What a great day. I'll go take care of Red later…


*We now go back to the other universe with Kyle and his friends and family.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: We did it! We saved Oakland! Now there can be a 5th generation of the story series! Thank you, Samantha! To show you my gratitude, I will make you a portal to Oakland where you shall live and be happy with all your friends and family. You shall be a child and live in peace and   hugony. Now go, Have fun in Oakland. But just note, It's night time there so be very quiet! Okay?


Samantha: Thanks for all your help!




*Samantha goes back to my house with Cecilia waiting there.*


Cecila: So, How'd it go?


Samantha: Pretty good!


Cecila: Can we go to Oakland?


Samantha: Yep! Just open the box and everyone will be in Oakland!


Cecila: Nice!


*Kyle hides under the bed.*


Samantha: The author will make us our own lab and it will be combined with Sophie's lab and Elese's lab to make one big lab! We just open the gift and we'll be teleported to Oakland. Just know it's night so we gotta be quiet.


Cecila: Oh, Ok!


*Samantha opens the box and the box does exactly what Samantha says.*


*Samantha is now in her own lab.*


*Kyle is hiding under a bed.*


*Sophie is in her lab and she notices a new lab. She opens the lab door and sees Samantha.*


Sophie : Hey new neighbors!


Samantha: Hi there!


*Kyle notices Sophie and passes out.*


Cecila: Hello. I'm Cecila and this is Samantha,


Samantha: Hiiiii!


Cecila: And Kyle who is hiding under the bed.


Sophie : Oh! He's just like Troy! Maybe in the morning, Those two kids can play.


Cecila: Certainly!


Sophie : Well, Imma hit the hay, We can fully meet each other tomorrow.


Cecila: Okay. Nighty night.


*Sophie Goes to her room and sleeps.*


Samantha: Alright Cecila, Goodnight.


Cecila: Night. *Turns off the lights.*


*Cecila goes to sleep.*


*Kyle sneaks out of the lab door and goes to Sophie's lab.*


*Troy sneaks out of his room and notices Kyle. Kyle notices Troy.*


Troy: Hi.


Kyle: Hi.


Kyle: What's your name?


Troy: Troy. What's yours?


Kyle: Kyle.


Troy: Did your sister torment you?


Kyle: Mhm.


Troy: Same.


*A magic hand is holding a flashlight. It hears a noise so it goes out of Sophie's room and goes down to the kitchen. The hand notices Kyle and Troy awake and the hand gets a Strawberry milk bottle.*


Troy: RUN!


Kyle: WHAT IS THAT THING?


Troy: It's Sophie's magic hands. They are making sure we have a good sleep and they make sure we are healthy. The hands think that we freak out that we are not healthy and happy do they feed us strawberry milk so we don't cry. They are really good but they kinda scare me. The hands are playing with us right now so we should probably run. You don't want the hands to make you laugh. Once they play, They make sure you are happy. I'm okay with it but i don't like it when the hands pet my head because it makes me cry but i love it when I am fed strawberry milk and healed.


Kyle: AH! I DON'T LIKE IT!


Troy: I'll protect you. *Hugs and holds onto Kyle gently. Making sure magic hands don't make Kyle scared.*


*The magic hand tries to touch Kyle.*


Troy: NO. MAGIC HAND, NO. KYLE IS NEW TO THIS. HE IS ACTUALLY SCARED OF YOU. PLEASE DON'T PLAY WITH HIM.


*The magic hand does a thumbs up and makes a special bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle and makes a normal strawberry milk bottle for Troy. The magic hand feeds the strawberry milk bottle to Troy and Troy grabs the bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle.*


Troy: I can feed the bottle to Kyle.


*The magic hand goes to the back of the room and watches.*


Troy: The magic hand is not near us anymore. Let me feed the strawberry milk to you and we'll   hug and sleep next to each other. I'll protect you.


Kyle: Okie.


*Kyle drinks the Strawberry milk and falls asleep. Troy also falls asleep and holds onto Kyle and hugs him. Kyle coos and Troy coos. The magic hand cleans up the magic strawberry milk bottle mess and puts a blanket over Troy and Kyle. The hand pars Troy and goes upstairs to the magic hands room and goes to sleep next to the other magic hands.*


*The next morning.*


Sophie : *Goes to the kitchen with the magic hands.* Aww! It looks like Kyle and Troy got along! Come on magic hands, Go eat your magic strawberry milk dust. I'm going to wake up Kyle and Troy.


Sophie : *Takes the blanket off Troy. Begins to hug Troy.*


Troy: *Wakes up and smiles* Hey Sophie!


Sophie : Hey Troy! Did you have a good sleep?


Troy: Yeah!


*Sophie is about to playfully wake up Kyle as well.*


Troy: Sophie. Remember the kid that became depressed when you played with him? You know how he hated it when you played with him?


Sophie : Yeah?


Troy: Do you want Kyle to have a heart attack? Kyle doesn't like being playfully waken up and he doesn't like playful people so please, Let me wake him up.


Sophie : Sorry. I didn't know that Kyle wasn't a playful kid. I'll let you wake him up.


*Troy hugs and holds and   hugs Kyle and wakes Kyle up.*


Kyle: *Wakes up and hugs Troy. Cries from a nightmare.*


Troy: *Feeds Strawberry milk to Kyle.* Shh, Shh. It's okay. What's wrong?


Kyle: Nightmare.


Troy: The nightmare is gone. I'm here for you.


Kyle: *Feels better.* Thankie!


Troy: No probbie!


*While Sophie and the others are carrying on their day, Let's see the magic hands morning routine!




*Morning routine.*


*The magic hands wake up and tickle Sophie. They playfully help her get ready and the magic hands go to the magic forest. They begin chasing each other and playing. An enemy approaches. Oh no! It's the evil magic hands! The magic hands fight the evil magic hands. The magic hands win and the evil magic hands become good magic hands and join Sophie's magic hand army. The magic hands go back to the lab and spend some time with the people in the lab then they spread all throughout Oakland and make others happy.*


*That is what the magic hands do everyday.*


*Back to Sophie. We now rejoin Sophie going to meet some of her old friends.*


Sophie : Hey guys! I missed you!


*Sophie takes her friends to the lab and she makes a room for them.*


*End of story. Story Series 5 coming soon.*

One week later…


Oakland has been pretty boring ever since Sophie disappeared and orbis took over.


*Luke wakes up in the enchanted magic forest and sees magic hands surrounding him.*


Luke: NO. I CAN'T BE HERE! AHHHHH! *Runs to Red's pizza.*


Luke: RED. I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE!


*Red answers the door.*


Red: How did you get back here from Louisiana?


Luke: I DON'T KNOW BUT I NEED HELP DESTROYING OAKLAND BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! I CAN'T TAKE THIS CONSTANT REPETITIVE LIFE. PLEASE STOP THIS  !


Red: You want to destroy Oakland and get rid of the magic and weirdness?


Luke: YES. PLEASE END THIS NEVER ENDING  !


Red: Ok. I'll help. But we need to come up with a plan…


*Epic plan making montage.*


Luke: Alright. Explain the plan to me again?


Red: Ok so we need to get rid of Orbis and Oakland's power. Since you are good at hacking you can distract Orbis while I    him and destroy his power of Oakland.


Luke: Ok. Let's do this.


*We now enter Red's pov*


Red: *Goes to Orbis's palace and sneaks in.*


*Orbis is watching Young Aaron.*


*Orbis doesn't notice Red.*


*Red snaps Orbis's neck and eats Orbis. Red then nukes Orbis's palace and powerplant.*


*Luke runs away from the explosion and meets Red at Soapbar's palace.*


Luke: I guess this is goodbye. Nah. JUST BLOW EVERYTHING UP!


Red: If you say so. Get on my back. I'll fly to safety.


Luke: K.


*Red flies Luke to safety. Luke watches Oakland get destroyed. Kurtis and Cleetus are with Luke. Romone and the Romanians+ King Aaron are also with Luke.*


*Red blows up Oakland.*


*A weird phenomenon happens where it seems that oakland reverts back to normal in a blink of an eye. It seems that there is something that prevents Oakland's destruction, but what could it be? Everyone is suddenly teleported back to Oakland and some strange border forms around the city. Everyone blacks out and their memories of this day happening were wiped. They all wake up back to where they were originally.*
Luke: *wakes up* huh.. What a weird dream. Wait a second… THAT WAS REAL! SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BRAINWASH ME!


*Luke goes to Red's.*


Luke: RED! I NEED YOUR HELP!


Red: I know. Oakland got resetted again.


Luke: HOW ARE YOU NOT AFFECTED?


Red: I'm a robot. I can't be affected by Oakland.


Luke: WHY DOESN'T THIS NIGHTMARE END???


Red: The only way to end this is to find the source…


Luke: Hmm. Maybe we can catch the thing that resets Oakland.


Red: And since the technology can't be affected, Maybe we could record the reset and see what is causing this.


Luke: Wow. That's actually not a bad idea!


Red: I've seen this happen many times… Where is Cleetus and the others?


Luke: Well, I don't know. Last time I saw them was when we were out of Oakland.


Red: So it seems like something is watching whatever the people do… Almost like a TV show where the director watches everything.


Luke: But this isn't a show. This is reality.


Red: We need to focus on the plan. Let's stop breaking the 4th wall.


Luke: K. So let's get a camera and you record the action since you can't be affected.


*Red gets a camera from somewhere and records Oakland.*


*Luke walks out of the border of Oakland and Oakland resets. Red caught the action on tape.*


Red: I got the recording- Oh right. Everytime Oakland resets, Every living thing is teleported back to the lab and/or their house.


*Luke runs out the lab. Magic hands chase him.*


Luke: RED! I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU. THE WATCHER. THAT'S THE GUY WHO IS CONTROLLING THIS. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS- IT'S UP TO YOU TO SAVE THE WORLD.


*The magic hands take Luke back to the lab and they treat him like a baby.*


Red: It's up to me, huh?


*Cleetus is heard screaming*


Red: Cleetus? Alright, Watcher. Reveal yourself to me. I want to have a chat.


*The watcher appears.*


The watcher : Hello there. My name is Kyle owner of Oakland. You can call me Kai. I see you have a question of how I run this town… AND THE WORLD!


Red: What have you done to Cleetus?


The Watcher: Oh nothing.


Red: TELL ME.


The watcher : Let's just say he's all tied up.


Red: STOP THIS AT ONCE.


The Watcher : Oh little Red , Soon you'll be just like everyone else. A child.


Red: NO.


The Watcher : Oh? Wanna fight for Oakland now? I'm stronger than everyone in this town. I can easily defeat you…


Red: Let's Play a game….


The Watcher : What kind of game?


Red: Oh you'll see… *Epic fighting montage*

*Red fights the watcher. Red is able to easily    the watcher.*


*The watcher is at 1% health*


Red: Now… Prepare to…  eEeEeEeEeEe…


*Red   s the watcher*


*The borders disappear. The magic hands let go of everyone.*


*Everyone is free to leave.*


*Luke leaves Oakland.*


Luke: I'M FREEEEEEEEEEE!


*All the ghost people rise from the grave and start chasing Troy out of Oakland.*


*Troy is officially in a new town. Luke is in a new town. Red stays in Oakland with Cleetus. All seems well.*




















*The watcher comes back to life.*


The watcher : Hahaha… that was my clone! You really think you could defeat me?


*The watcher brings everyone back to Oakland and puts the border back over Oakland.*


Luke: GRRRRRRRRRRRR!


The Watcher : Sorry Red but… *Kicks Red out of Oakland and puts a metal forcefield over Oakland.*


Luke: AHHHHH! WE ARE ALL HOPELESS! EVERYONE, RUN!!!!!


*Troy drinks his Strawberry milk and looks at the watcher. He just stares at the watcher.*


The watcher : Hello Troy! What are you doing?


Troy: Drinking my Strawberry milk!


The watcher : Well what if I gave you an unlimited supply of this stuff? All you gotta do is convince your friends to drink it and make sure to do what the magic hands do then you can have all the Strawberry milk you want!


Troy: So I just do what I do to Sam but i do it to everyone?


The watcher : Yes.


Troy: Okie! *I notice Luke and I run up to him.*


Troy: *Grabs Luke and force feeds him Strawberry milk then hugs him.* Hey Lukie!


Luke: *Tries to force Troy off of me but Troy doesn't stop. Starts to become sleepy and starts to become like Troy.*


Troy: Aww! Now onto my other fwiends!


*Troy turns everyone into a Troy and the watcher puts hypnosis helmets on everyone.*


The watcher : Repeat after me. I will not be evil. I will do what the watcher tells me to do.


*Meanwhile with Red.*


Red: *Tries to get in.* WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE PEOPLE IN THERE?


*Red sees everyone brainwashed.*


Red: What the- What the heck is happening?


The watcher : *Teleports Red into Oakland.* I'm glad you asked! I just made everyone like Troy!


Red: YOU BRAINWASHED AND HYPNOTIZED THESE… KIDS?


The watcher : I'm only protecting them…


Red: STOP BRAINWASHING THEM!


*To be continued…*


Narrator: Welcome to the newest Story Series episode.


Let's begin.


*In Oakland, There lives one boy who goes by the name of Duke. Duke was a child just like everyone else in Oakland but Duke had one fear. Angels! Everytime Duke saw a angel, Duke would scream and panic kinda like Troy except Duke was fearful of Angels only. Let's see how our story goes.*


*Let's begin.*


Duke: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Sees my pa.*


Duke: Hi Pa.


Duke's pa: Howdy, Duke!


*Duke eats breakfast.*


Duke: I'm going to see Orbis. Is that ok?


Duke's pa: Yeah. I don't mind.


*Duke goes to Orbis.*


Duke's pa: Now I'm alone…


Ghost : No you aren't!


Duke's pa: AH- Oh. Hello.


Ghost: My name is Trista!


Duke's pa: You are such a cute ghost! Wanna go move to the Bahamas and spend some time together?


Ghost: What about the kid?


Duke's pa: Sophie can take care of him.


Ghost: Works for me!


*Duke's pa and the ghost move to the Bahamas.*


*Meanwhile with Duke.*


*Duke is now at Orbis's palace.*


Duke: Hey Orbis.


Orbis: Hello Duke. What can I do for you?


Duke: Can I have a tour of Soapbar's lab?


Orbis: Yes you can. Is your dad around?


Duke: He left me for a ghost.


Orbis: Oh! So sad! Let me take you to Elese and she'll take care of you.


Duke: Okay!


*Orbis walks Duke to Elese's lab.*


*Orbis knocks on Elese's door to her lab.*


*Elese answers the door.*


Orbis: Hello Elese! This is a kid without a parent called Duke.


Elese: Aww! He's so cute! I think he'll be perfect here.


Orbis: Alright. Well, I'm going back to my place, Take care of Elese for me!


Elese: Ok!


Orbis: *Goes back to my place.*


Elese: Come on in, Duke!


*Duke comes in his house.*


Elese: Do you need anything, Duke?


Duke: No.


Elese: You look a bit tired, Duke. Are you okay?


Duke: Yeah. I haven't really slept much.


Elese: Why can't you sleep?


Duke: That is personal information I cannot disclose to you.


Elese: I understand. You don't have to tell me. I still do want you to sleep though.


Duke: But I don't want to sleep.


Elese: I have the perfect place for you to sleep.


Duke: Please not the basement..


Elese: NO! NEVER!  You are going to a comfortable sleeping room!


Duke: O-Okay.


*Elese takes Duke to a bedroom with a child Duke's age sleeping. Elese puts Duke next to the child.*


Elese: Hug the child.


Duke: Why?


Elese: The child is sad and I think you'll feel good when you hug him. *Turns off the lights and tucks Duke in. Makes Duke hug the child gently and closes the bedroom door.*


Duke: *Falls asleep and starts to panic as I'm dreaming.*


*The other child wakes up and sees Duke hugging. The child feels better but the child sees Duke panicking so the other kid hugs Duke and goes back to sleep.*


Duke (Dreaming): AHH! WHERE AM I?


*The other kid appears in Duke's dream.*


Duke (Dreaming): SOMEBODY HELP ME!


*The other kid taps on Duke*


Kale (Other kid): Hey, You ok?


Duke: NO! I'M NOT OK! MY BIGGEST FEARS ARE ALL AROUND ME! PWEASE HELP ME!


*Kale hugs Duke gently*


Kale: Shhhh. You were the one who hugged me while I was asleep, Now I'm going to return the favor to you.


Duke: Please pwotect me…


Kale: *Continues hugging.* I will.


Duke: Thank you…


Kale: No problem.


*An angel flies over to Duke.*


Duke: *Screams*


*The angel tries to hug Duke.*


Duke: *Screams and wakes up.*


Kale: *Wakes up and looks at Duke.*


Duke: Hey.


Kale: I'm going to protect you.


Duke: Thank you. *Hugs and kisses kale.*


*Elese comes into the room .*


Elese: Hey Duke and Kale- AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! YOU TWO ARE SO ADORABLE!


Duke: I'm hungry!


Elese: Well, Let's eat!


Kale: What are we eating?


Elese: What do you cuties want to eat.


Kale: Idk. Surprise us.


Elese: Okay!


*Elese makes the food.*


*After she makes the food.*


Elese: Alright kids, Dig in! I made you cuties some breakfast!


*Duke and Kale eat*


*After they eat*


Kale: I’m full.


Duke: Me too.


Elese: Well kids, I was thinking that today we could go somewhere fun! I was thinking we could go to a different dimension!


Kale: Sounds fun!


Duke: I’m down.


Elese: Alright! Now if I could just find my portal gun then we could- *Sees my magic portal gun* Aha! Found it! *I open a portal to the wrong dimension and I try to close the portal. Duke gets sucked into the portal and the portal closes.*


Kale: Oh no! Duke got sucked into the portal! What do we do?


Elese: I think the portal gun is broken. I’m going to fix it then we need to open the portal. For now though, Just chill out.


*Meanwhile with Duke*


*Duke gets up. He is now in a dimension full of nice, gentle and friendly angels with powers! Duke won’t like that…*


*Duke looks around. Duke is terrified.*


*A angel flies down to Duke.*


Angey: Hello! My name is Angey! You must be a small human child! What’s your name, Child?


Duke: AHHHH! NO! MY NIGHTMARES ARE REAL!!!!! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Angey: Hey! Are you-


*Duke starts to cry.*


Angey: Woah! Please don’t cry! It’s ok!


*All the angels see Duke crying and they fly over to Duke and hug him and play with him. The angels begin to comfort Duke and try to calm Duke down. Duke starts to turn red and Duke’s eyes go wide. The angels use their angel powers to do everything they can to help Duke but Duke is still mentally hurt.*


*One of the angels uses their mind healing powers to heal Duke’s mind. Duke starts to cry even more. The angels hug and   hug Duke and they begin to cry with Duke. Duke realizes these angels are not a threat and Duke calms down. Duke is then introduced to angel city and the angels protect Duke. They teach Duke about their leader, God and how they praise him and worship him. The angels introduce Duke to worship music and the angels take care of Duke.*


*Meanwhile, Elese and Kale have fixed the portal gun and they go into the dimension. They enter into the angel dimension and the angels all welcome Kale and Elese. Duke runs to Kale and hugs him. The angels wave goodbye to Duke and the others and the angels resume their normal activity.*


*Duke has a good life*


*End of story*
Hey guys, Young Aaron here. Today we are going to be talking about how we can improve the Young Aaron personality. If you don't know what Young Aaron is, He is a young version of modern day Tick. Tick decided to revive his young self because he enjoys his younger self but he wants to change his younger self to be better. Young Aaron is the official mascot of the Tick YouTube channel and Tick has decided to make a series about it. By the way, The T.G.O.G series will continue. I am not ending it. I'm just thinking of new episode ideas. Now, Without further Ado, Let's begin today's Young Aaron research. This is the first time I am researching but I hope it goes well. So, Let's start our research.


Alright guys. So the first step to building a better Young me is to eliminate evil and replace it with good and   the kid with Compassion and kindness. That way, It'll make young Aaron less of an evil kid and more of a nicer kid! We also should eliminate bullying as bullying is not allowed on my channel. We also need to make sure Young Aaron's character is respectful, Kid-like and innocent but not hurtful or mean to others. We need to make sure Young Aaron can help others be Christian and that is do what I plan to do. I plan to make everyone better persons and Christians. Now that we got all the big important info out of the way, Let's talk about what videos I will be making! So I will be making some very respectful videos that teach people lessons. I will also be making some narrations, I'll be doing many different things just like Tick! I'll also be helping you guys out AND I'LL BE DOING LIVE STREAMS! IT'LL BE SO FUN! My streams will be very different from Tick's streams though. So, What other things will I be talking about in this research? Nothing. I've run out of ideas for this research. (WHY DO I PLAY AMERICAN IDOL? I DON'T WAAAAAANA PLAY IT ANYMORE DO LET'S HIDE IN THE OLD DAYS AND PLAY AMERICAN IDOL WHILE DRINKING A CUP OF GREEN TEA. This will be spoken in a very dramatic and deep funny voice.)

I  PRESENT  TO YOU the one the only made by me
IN THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By: AARON
What people need to know is that i think i could spend time with my friends in the future because they care about me. for exzample i went a abanded arcade place that has animatronics that still work, also i enjoy playing the arcade there, my friends are also nice to me, and we have fun exploring i went to the ambaned pizza place for exzample they have a old maskout chuck e cheese, and the animatronic band is 101 lbs. I had to call a tow truck that could lift it. I will have to call the tow truck tommrow.
Since the animatronics are still at the pizza place i maby[c] i could haul the animatronics to my house. But the problem is i can`t haul the animatronic band in my mom`s car. So i will have to call a tow truck to tow today it can just pick up the broken parts and tow it to my house. I have solved the problem. So if you ever want a animatronic band just go to a abanded pizza place that has animatronics that still work un plug the animatronic, then call a tow truck, finley wait till the tow truck comes to your house then you will have a animatronic band.  I hope you enjoyed my document bye bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So one day at reds redthebear was hm….. Let's see here i think he was… oh i remember! He was kissing roxy. Also another day at romones he was feeding clammy but than clammy broke the wall of jawbreaker. So meanwhile at reds, red was still kissing roxy when suddenly the phone rang. Red answered it and romone said something. “Hey red how ya do- but… this is not what the story is about… this is about the war of video games... all of the video games in the universe went into war…… so another day at reds red was panicking because of the war and he was smashing the walls and tipping over the ball pit and all of the balls slid down stairs and scattered all over the place “red why are you going crazy?” “OMG CAN'T YOU SEE? THERE IS A WAR OUT THERE!!!” so meanwhile in romones clammy could not stop eating romone and romone accidentally   ed clammy and   ed lamone in his romone pack “ romone, you gotta stop doing this!!!! You're trashing the palace and we have a low amount of survivors because of you!!!!” “ WELL TO BAD YOU GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF DUMB AND STUPID CANDY WEAKLINGS!!!!!!” meanwhile at reds again red has calmed down and apologised and now he is fixing the walls and ball pit. “ hey red i know it is rough out there and i know it made you panic.” “ well i was thinking... remember that time when i stopped that nuke? You helped me! and if we survived that we can survive anything so let's go out there and show them whos boss!!!!” “ ya let's go!” so they went into the war and   ed tons of characters. Meanwhile at romones romone still was not calmed down yet. I WILL    you romone pack  ha ha ha ha ha! Any last words?” “romone your crazy ‘gets a gun and clammy eats it. “ HAHAHAHA   *threw acid at the romone pack.”  yes i   ed ramone because i blocked it and it bounced off at ramone HA HA i can't   BUT YOU CAN!!!   *clammy eats ramone pack* GOOD JOB CLAMMY SO YOUR NOT SO USELESS WHAT DID YOU SAY? Meanwhile at the war red and roxy were hiding from spring snap “ok maybe this was a bad idea was it roxy?” “yeah i guess… WAIT! You can use you're special powers together!!” “but how?” “believe.” “fine.” then red did his ultra power demon moves and said “may the black dove always carry you.” and all the video games got sucked back into their original games. Romone looked at the candy tv very bored and flipping through the channels, all of a sudden, the news flipped on and said “breaking news, the town of las vegas has been saved by redthebear once again!!” romone sighed as he said “i wish i could meet him, oh wait! I can I'LL JUST MAKE A PORTAL!!!” so he built a portal and turned it on waiting for red to go in it.

anything. Rule 2. Do not leave the park unless we say you guys
can. Rule 3. Don’t go in the woods. Got it?” Then I said, “Yes
Mom. We got it.” Toti also said “Yes, we got it. We’ll follow the
rules...” Tatra, my mom said “Ok. Now you kids go do whatever
you kids do these days.” I said “Ok.” Then me and Toti went to
swing on the swings. 30 minutes later I decided to go see what
Margy was doing and Margy was on her cell phone googling
random things. A few minutes later, Margy decided to come to
us and she said this “ Hey guys. Wanna play tag?” I said sure.
Toti said “sure why not?” So we played tag for 1 hour and after
playing tag, Margy went to her original location and went on her
phone. Then Margy got off her cell phone and went to us, and
she asked both of us “Hey guys! Do you want to break a rule that
we aren’t supposed to break?” I said “Um. I don’t mean to be a
party pooper but... Don’t you think that is a bad idea? We might
get in trouble!” Margy said “Oh shut up! We won’t get caught if
we don’t tell them!” My sister Toti said “I’m down!” Margy said
“Come on Aaron! Let’s go to the woods! I promise they won’t find
out!” So I said “Ok as long as they don’t find out...” Oh but boy
was I wrong! So we went far into the woods that Tatra specifically
told us not to go into. Then after 40 minutes of playing in the
woods, We came out and Margy said “See? I told you our moms
won’t find out!” Tatra knew we were in the woods all along and
came up to us and said “Were you guys in those woods? I
thought I heard you guys there...” Margy said “this was all
Aaron’s idea! I had nothing to do with it!” Tatra said “You are in a
lot of trouble mister!” Then Margy’s mom took Margy home and
Tatra took us home. As soon as I came in the door of my house
Tatra said “I can’t believe you two would go in the woods! For
breaking my rules you both are grounded for one month!” I said “But Mom! I- I- I didn’t do it! It was Margy! Please! BELIEVE
ME!!!!” Tatra said “I have heard enough YOU ARE
GROUNDED!!!!” As I went into my room, I planned to prove my
innocence. So I came up with a plan. One month later when I got
ungrounded, We went to the park again but this time i got my
phone. So Margy went into the woods and she started bragging
about how she wasn’t going to be in trouble and that I was. The
whole time she said that, I was recording her. So after she
stopped bragging she said “What are you doing?” I said “Um...
Nothing?” I ran to Tatra and explained to her what happened, and
I showed Margy’s mom the video. Margy ran up to my mom and
said “Mrs. Tatra! It wasn’t me! I was framed!”
Her mom came up to her and said “It wasn’t you? Then why does
that video show proof? Are you lying?” Margy said “No! I was
framed!” Margy’s mom said “YOU FRAMED AARON!!! When we
get home you are in a lot of trouble Missy...”
Margy’s mom dragged Margy home.
Margy got grounded. My mom said “I’m sorry for blaming you...
you are a good kid and you’d never do this.” I said “It’s ok mom. I
understand. Margy’s mom called Tatra and apologized. Margy
got disciplined. Margy never went into those woods again.

*There was a boy who was 13. There was also a girl who was 10. These two kids lived together. The boy would always get teased by the girl. One day, The boy became silent. He would avoid the girl completely. The boy was named Kyle and the girl was named Cecilia. Let's see what happens next!


*Present day*


Cecila: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Tries to find Kyle. I can't find him. I notice a note at the front door. It's from Kyle.* A note? Not again… Probably ANOTHER STUPID NOTE ABOUT WORK OR HOW HE'S "Sorry"... WHAT A PATHETIC DISGUSTING BROTHER I HAVE.


*The note reads "Hello, Ceceila. If you are reading this, Well, I'm leaving. I'm going to do what you told me to do! Jump off a bridge and  ! I'm going to never be around you again. I'm going to leave. You'll never see me again. Goodbye forever."*


Cecila : I don't give a crap if he's dead!


*Meanwhile with Kyle.*


Kyle: Well, Time to  …


*Someone notices Kyle about to jump. The person grabs Kyle and hugs him.*


Samantha: Sir, Please tell me, Why did you want to jump?


Kyle: My family doesn't care about me.


Samantha: But you are so young! You have so much to learn.


Kyle: Nobody gives a care about me.


Samantha: Well I "give a" care about you.


Kyle: Really?


Samantha: Yeah. How about I take you to my house? It's pretty close by to where we are!


Kyle: O-Okay.


*Samantha takes Kyle to his house.*


Samantha: Well, Here we are?


Kyle: WE ARE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD! Are you my neighbor?


Samantha: I guess so?


Kyle: My family lives here…


Samantha: Don't worry. I'll protect you from your family.


Kyle: Thank you.


*A few days later.*


Kyle: Hey Samantha?


Samantha: Yeah?


Kyle: You know that one show called the story series?


Samantha: Mhm, What about it?


Kyle: Can we try to revive it?


Samantha: Well I happen to know the creator so yeah!


Kyle: Ok!


*Meanwhile with Cecilia*


Cecila : I miss mom and dad… Now that Kyle is gone… I can't talk to anyone… I didn't mean to hurt him! I thought I was joking with him! Well, It's too late for me to apologize to Kyle since he's dead. *Cries* I miss Kyle!


*Cecila pulls herself together.*


Cecila : Maybe I'll go on a walk. That'll clear my head!


*Cecila walks out of her house. She decides to see what her neighbor is up to. Cecila knocks on the neighbor's door.*


Samantha: *Hears the knock.* Oh! I'll get it!


*Samantha answers the door. Kyle sees Cecilia and hides under his bed.*


Samantha: Hi! How can I help you, Neighbor?


Cecila : I want to talk about something…


Samantha: Have you been crying?


Cecila : Yeah. I miss my family…


Samantha: Come on in. I'll make you some Strawberry milk. Maybe my friend can cheer you up or something.


Cecila : That'd be nice.


*Cecila comes in Samantha's house and makes herself comfy.*


Samantha: I'll get you some Strawberry milk.


Cecila : Ok.


*Cecila looks around.* I really miss mom and dad…


*Kyle covers his ears.*


Kyle: Ugh. All she cared about was mom… I'm not listening to anything.


Cecila : I also cared about my brother, Kyle. He means the world to me.


Samantha: Sounds like you have a nice family.


Cecila : Yeah. I just miss them.


Samantha: You know, What's funny is I have a friend called Kyle!


Cecila : What. Take me to him!


Samantha: *Brings Cecilia into the guest bedroom.* He should be in here somewhere- *Sees Kyle under the bed and drags him out from under the bed.*


Kyle: *Tries to hold on but is lifted up and revealed to Cecilia.*


Cecila : It really is him… I thought he  d!


Samantha: Huh? What do you mean?


*Kyle runs out the room.*


Cecila : Great. He ran out of the room. Well, That Kyle is my brother.


Samantha: He told me some things about you…


Cecila : I know. I've been awful to him but I decided to become nicer and I wanted to apologize to him.


Samantha: That's good. Maybe you can invite him for dinner at your house?


Cecila : He'll just run off when he sees me.


Samantha: Oh. Maybe I can keep him still?


Cecila: He'll be scarred for life if he sees me. He'll think we're bullying him.


Samantha: Can we both hug him then?


Cecila : Maybe that'll work but I don't know if he'll be ok with that…


Samantha: Ok. Well, let's try it. I'll go in first.


*Kyle can overhear the conversation.*

Kyle: *Doesn't stop.*


Samantha: PLEASE CALM DOWN!


Cecila : I don't think he likes this…


Samantha: This clearly isn't working. *Lets Kyle free.*


Kyle: *Runs off. Goes under my bed.*


Cecila : I think I may have one other solution to our problem.


Kyle: What is it?


Cecila : There was this old show that Kyle used to watch called The Story Series. It ended a week ago. Maybe if we revive it then we can get some answers from the characters on what to do.


Samantha: Ok. *Turns on a TV* No way… It says here that somebody already revived the story series! I think I have a idea. Ok so hear me out. If we can replicate Sophie's magic staff, Then we could travel to Oakland through a portal and have Sophie fix Kyle, and thus, We'd be featured on a Story Series show!


Cecila : But the author clearly says that it ended!
Samantha: Let's go pay the author a visit…


*Samantha goes to Aaron's house.*


Samantha: Excuse me, Is this where the author of the story series lives?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Why yes it is! The name's Aaron. Aaron. J. Hebbler. I'm the writer and producer of the story series.


Samantha: Why did you end the series?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: LD took over my series. He possessed the watcher and now everyone in Oakland is unsafe. Everyone in Oakland is going cookoo crazy and my series is dying. If only I could have some executive producer for my show.


Samantha: Why don't I help?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Writing a story takes tons of work. You'd need hundreds of bottles of green tea and you'd need powerful music to be a able to write the stories that I write. Are you sure you want to do this?


Samantha: Teach me the way of the story series. Train me.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Ok. *Gets a carpet. Sets up the carpet and grabs some green tea bottles. Place 2 next to me and 2 on the other side of the carpet.* Sit down and drink your tea. Close your eyes and think of ideas.


Samantha: Ok. *Drinks green tea and thinks.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Think about your idea and write. You are now trained in the art of Story Series.


Samantha: *Bows to Aaron* Thank you, Sensei Aaron.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: No prob. Now write the story with me! We are going to continue this series!


*Meanwhile in the story series world.*


Lord Conner (LD): HAHAHA! YOU FOOLS! I NOW RULE OAKLAND! YOU CAN'T STOP ME! SURRENDER TO ME! YOUR PRECIOUS WATCHER IS GONE… I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REALLY THOUGHT THE WATCHER BRAINWASHED YOU! BY   ING HIM, YOU DESTROYED THIS BORDER AND NOW, I CAN FINALLY    EVERYONE IN THE WORLD- *Cage appears and locks Lord Conner in. The watcher comes out of the ground and is angry at LD.*


The Watcher : Haha! I am revived! Thanks Aaron!


Aaron (Story series version): No prob!


The watcher : NOBODY ENSLAVES MY PEOPLE! *Rebuilds the border and rebuilds the buildings. Rebuilds everything. Restores Oakland and its compassionate people. Revives Orbis and all the Oakland laws. Puts Red back in Cincinnati and turns Lord Conner into a child. Puts Lord Conner in a maximum security mental health hospital. Removes all the evilness and replaces it with good in every evil character. Revives everything magic. Restores Oakland completely. Restores the USB and magic   friendk. Restores Elese and all the older characters. Removes the glitches and bugs. Revives everything good and fixes everything.* Oakland is restored!

You will no longer be hurt and its thanks to God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit and for Aaron. Thank you very much and goodnight, Oakland!


*It is now night in Oakland and all the children go to sleep.*


The watcher : *Watches over my mighty town. The protection of God is over this town.* Ah, What a great day. I'll go take care of Red later…


*We now go back to the other universe with Kyle and his friends and family.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: We did it! We saved Oakland! Now there can be a 5th generation of the story series! Thank you, Samantha! To show you my gratitude, I will make you a portal to Oakland where you shall live and be happy with all your friends and family. You shall be a child and live in peace and   hugony.

Cecila: Nice!


*Kyle hides under the bed.*


Samantha: The author will make us our own lab and it will be combined with Sophie's lab and Elese's lab to make one big lab! We just open the gift and we'll be teleported to Oakland. Just know it's night so we gotta be quiet.

Cecila: Certainly!


Sophie : Well, Imma hit the hay, We can fully meet each other tomorrow.


Cecila: Okay. Nighty night.


*Sophie Goes to her room and sleeps.*


Samantha: Alright Cecila, Goodnight.


Cecila: Night. *Turns off the lights.*


*Cecila goes to sleep.*


*Kyle sneaks out of the lab door and goes to Sophie's lab.*


*Troy sneaks out of his room and notices Kyle. Kyle notices Troy.*


Troy: Hi.


Kyle: Hi.


Kyle: What's your name?


Troy: Troy. What's yours?


Kyle: Kyle.


Troy: Did your sister torment you?


Kyle: Mhm.


Troy: Same.


*A magic hand is holding a flashlight. It hears a noise so it goes out of Sophie's room and goes down to the kitchen. The hand notices Kyle and Troy awake and the hand gets a Strawberry milk bottle.*


Troy: RUN!


Kyle: WHAT IS THAT THING?


Troy: It's Sophie's magic hands. They are making sure we have a good sleep and they make sure we are healthy. The hands think that we freak out that we are not healthy and happy do they feed us strawberry milk so we don't cry. They are really good but they kinda scare me. The hands are playing with us right now so we should probably run. You don't want the hands to make you laugh. Once they play, They make sure you are happy. I'm okay with it but i don't like it when the hands pet my head because it makes me cry but i love it when I am fed strawberry milk and healed.


Kyle: AH! I DON'T LIKE IT!


Troy: I'll protect you. *Hugs and holds onto Kyle gently. Making sure magic hands don't make Kyle scared.*


*The magic hand tries to touch Kyle.*


Troy: NO. MAGIC HAND, NO. KYLE IS NEW TO THIS. HE IS ACTUALLY SCARED OF YOU. PLEASE DON'T PLAY WITH HIM.


*The magic hand does a thumbs up and makes a special bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle and makes a normal strawberry milk bottle for Troy. The magic hand feeds the strawberry milk bottle to Troy and Troy grabs the bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle.*


Troy: I can feed the bottle to Kyle.


*The magic hand goes to the back of the room and watches.*


Troy: The magic hand is not near us anymore. Let me feed the strawberry milk to you and we'll   hug and sleep next to each other. I'll protect you.


Kyle: Okie.


*Kyle drinks the Strawberry milk and falls asleep. Troy also falls asleep and holds onto Kyle and hugs him. Kyle coos and Troy coos. The magic hand cleans up the magic strawberry milk bottle mess and puts a blanket over Troy and Kyle. The hand pars Troy and goes upstairs to the magic hands room and goes to sleep next to the other magic hands.*


*The next morning.*


Sophie : *Goes to the kitchen with the magic hands.* Aww! It looks like Kyle and Troy got along! Come on magic hands, Go eat your magic strawberry milk dust. I'm going to wake up Kyle and Troy.


Sophie : *Takes the blanket off Troy. Begins to hug Troy.*


Troy: *Wakes up and smiles* Hey Sophie!


Sophie : Hey Troy! Did you have a good sleep?


Troy: Yeah!


*Sophie is about to playfully wake up Kyle as well.*


Troy: Sophie. Remember the kid that became depressed when you played with him? You know how he hated it when you played with him?


Sophie : Yeah?


Troy: Do you want Kyle to have a heart attack? Kyle doesn't like being playfully waken up and he doesn't like playful people so please, Let me wake him up.


Sophie : Sorry. I didn't know that Kyle wasn't a playful kid. I'll let you wake him up.


*Troy hugs and holds and   hugs Kyle and wakes Kyle up.*


Kyle: *Wakes up and hugs Troy. Cries from a nightmare.*


Troy: *Feeds Strawberry milk to Kyle.* Shh, Shh. It's okay. What's wrong?


Kyle: Nightmare.


Troy: The nightmare is gone. I'm here for you.


Kyle: *Feels better.* Thankie!


Troy: No probbie!

Red: So what's going on?


Romone: Look at Sophie.


Red: Uh. Why is there a dog that is being treated like a Troy?


Romone: Um. I don't know.


Red: Well I'm going to stop it.


Red: *Goes to Sophie.*


Sophie: Hi Red! What are you and Romone doing here?


Romone: What are you doing to that poor dog?


Sophie: I'm just treating it like I treat Troy!


Romone: Let go of the dog.


Sophie: NO.


Red: *Grabs Petie from Sophie and takes the pacifier and strawberry milk bottle out of the dog's   mothe.*


*The dog starts crying like a Troy.*


Petie: WOOOOOOOOOOF!


Red: What… Did you do to the dog?


Romone: She turned it into a Troy.


Sophie: Give me the dog back!


Romone: No. I'm going to take care of Petite since you can't do it.


Sophie: The dog is gonna   from sugar if he lives with you!


Romone: I have special candy for dogs. He'll be completely fine.


Sophie: Then if I can't have a pet then… I'm going to turn everyone into a Troy…


*Sophie kicks Red and Romone out of her lab and she locks the door. Sophie sees Tick and Troy eating. Sophie looks at Tick with delight.*


Sophie: Hehehe. *Sneaks behind Tick and waits for him to finish eating. Then I snatch Tick.*


Troy: Sophie, What are you doing to Tick?


Sophie: Tick is gonna be my pet!


Troy: Oh no no no! You've already done this.


Sophie: IF I CAN'T TURN ANYONE INTO A PET, THEN I'M GOING TO MAKE EVERYONE A CHILD FOREVER. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO AGE AND YOU'LL ALL BE FED STRAWBERRY MILK. YOU'LL ALL BE MY PETS! MUHAHAHA!


*Sophie Goes to Orbis's palace and she tries to beat up Orbis but Orbis turns Sophie into a permanent child.*

Sophie: HEY! WHAT THE HECK?


Orbis: You never learn, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO    YOU AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE!


Orbis: No you ain't. I'm much stronger than you. I'm the second strongest entity in this town. If you    me then you    everyone in this world. I'm not letting you destroy this town with your evil ways, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO    Y-


Orbis: Shut up. *puts Sophie to sleep.*


Sophie: N-


Orbis: That takes care of that.


*Orbis goes to the lab and sees what's going on.*


Orbis: Hey. Um. I don't know why Sophie is going crazy again but uh. I guess I'm going to take over this lab since Sophie is crazy and she is mentally unstable.


Tick: No more being called Tucky?


Orbis: No. You are still Tucky.


Tick: You should know I hate being called Tucky.

Troy: I want it! Give me Strawberry milk!


Orbis: Ok. If that's what you want then ok. *Makes Troy a bottle of Strawberry milk.* There you go.


*Troy drinks the strawberry milk and starts to cry and scream.*


Orbis: Troy, Go to your room.


Troy: Ok! *Goes to me and Sam's room.*


Orbis: Ok Tick. What do you want to eat?


Tick (Pissed off): I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO I WANT? *Stares at Orbis' eyes.*


Orbis: I'm guessing you are still mad at me. I'm just gonna make you some Mac n cheese.*


Tick: *Gasps* MAC AND CHEESE? YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!


Orbis: Why does everyone just scream in my town? This town makes no sense.


Red: I know.


Orbis: Oh. Hi Red. I don't know how I didn't notice you. Anyways, Back to cooking!


*Orbis makes some Mac and cheese for Tick.*


Orbis: Here you go.


Tick: *Wolfs down the entire batch of Mac and cheese.* Thanks. *Runs back to my room with my Nintendo switch.*


Orbis: Now Luke, What do you want to eat?


Luke: I am not hungry.


Orbis: I can see through your stomach. You are hungry. Now eat.


Luke: Wait. What now?


Orbis: I can see through your stomach.


Luke: NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Orbis: No I'm not getting away from you. You need to eat. Now don't act like a Troy now…


Luke: Don't act like a Troy? Don't you call me a Troy!


Orbis: I can call you whatever you want.


Luke: Oh really? Wanna fight?


Orbis: I don't fight my fellow citizens.


Luke: FIGHT ME.


Orbis: No.


Luke: BEAT ME.


Orbis: No.


*Red looks at Luke*


Red: You remind me of Troy except you don't spray Strawberry milk on me and run around my pizzeria.


Luke: *Starts to throw a temper tantrum.*


Orbis: Stop it Luke. Don't make me do it…


*Luke doesn't stop.*


*Luke screams as Orbis scares Luke off.*


*Luke runs out of Ohio and runs to Louisiana. Red takes him there.*


Luke: Thanks Red.


*Red flies back to ohio.*


Luke: *I am angry at everyone.*


Young Aaron: IN LOUISIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA!


Luke: GRRR. SHUT UP. YOU ARE ANNOYING ME.


Young Aaron: Waaw! Why ywou mwean?


Luke: Sorry. I'm just angry at people.


Young Aaron: Oh. Iwt owk.


There is a strange force that flings Luke back. When he gets up young Aaron is nowhere to be found.


One week later…


Oakland has been pretty boring ever since Sophie disappeared and orbis took over.


*Luke wakes up in the enchanted magic forest and sees magic hands surrounding him.*


Luke: NO. I CAN'T BE HERE! AHHHHH! *Runs to Red's pizza.*


Luke: RED. I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE!


*Red answers the door.*


Red: How did you get back here from Louisiana?


Luke: I DON'T KNOW BUT I NEED HELP DESTROYING OAKLAND BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! I CAN'T TAKE THIS CONSTANT REPETITIVE LIFE. PLEASE STOP THIS  !


Red: You want to destroy Oakland and get rid of the magic and weirdness?


Luke: YES. PLEASE END THIS NEVER ENDING  !


Red: Ok. I'll help. But we need to come up with a plan…


*Epic plan making montage.*


Luke: Alright. Explain the plan to me again?


Red: Ok so we need to get rid of Orbis and Oakland's power. Since you are good at hacking you can distract Orbis while I    him and destroy his power of Oakland.


Luke: Ok. Let's do this.


*We now enter Red's pov*


Red: *Goes to Orbis's palace and sneaks in.*


*Orbis is watching Young Aaron.*


*Orbis doesn't notice Red.*


*Red snaps Orbis's neck and eats Orbis. Red then nukes Orbis's palace and powerplant.*


*Luke runs away from the explosion and meets Red at Soapbar's palace.*


Luke: I guess this is goodbye. Nah. JUST BLOW EVERYTHING UP!


Red: If you say so. Get on my back. I'll fly to safety.


Luke: K.


*Red flies Luke to safety. Luke watches Oakland get destroyed. Kurtis and Cleetus are with Luke. Romone and the Romanians+ King Aaron are also with Luke.*


*Red blows up Oakland.*


*A weird phenomenon happens where it seems that oakland reverts back to normal in a blink of an eye. It seems that there is something that prevents Oakland's destruction, but what could it be? Everyone is suddenly teleported back to Oakland and some strange border forms around the city. Everyone blacks out and their memories of this day happening were wiped. They all wake up back to where they were originally.*
Luke: *wakes up* huh.. What a weird dream. Wait a second… THAT WAS REAL! SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BRAINWASH ME!


*Luke goes to Red's.*


Luke: RED! I NEED YOUR HELP!


Red: I know. Oakland got resetted again.


Luke: HOW ARE YOU NOT AFFECTED?


Red: I'm a robot. I can't be affected by Oakland.


Luke: WHY DOESN'T THIS NIGHTMARE END???


Red: The only way to end this is to find the source…


Luke: Hmm. Maybe we can catch the thing that resets Oakland.


Red: And since the technology can't be affected, Maybe we could record the reset and see what is causing this.


Luke: Wow. That's actually not a bad idea!


Red: I've seen this happen many times… Where is Cleetus and the others?


Luke: Well, I don't know. Last time I saw them was when we were out of Oakland.


Red: So it seems like something is watching whatever the people do… Almost like a TV show where the director watches everything.


Luke: But this isn't a show. This is reality.


Red: We need to focus on the plan. Let's stop breaking the 4th wall.


Luke: K. So let's get a camera and you record the action since you can't be affected.


*Red gets a camera from somewhere and records Oakland.*


*Luke walks out of the border of Oakland and Oakland resets. Red caught the action on tape.*


Red: I got the recording- Oh right. Everytime Oakland resets, Every living thing is teleported back to the lab and/or their house.


*Luke runs out the lab. Magic hands chase him.*


Luke: RED! I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU. THE WATCHER. THAT'S THE GUY WHO IS CONTROLLING THIS. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS- IT'S UP TO YOU TO SAVE THE WORLD.


*The magic hands take Luke back to the lab and they treat him like a baby.*


Red: It's up to me, huh?


*Cleetus is heard screaming*


Red: Cleetus? Alright, Watcher. Reveal yourself to me. I want to have a chat.


*The watcher appears.*


The watcher : Hello there. My name is Kyle owner of Oakland. You can call me Kai. I see you have a question of how I run this town… AND THE WORLD!


Red: What have you done to Cleetus?


The Watcher: Oh nothing.


Red: TELL ME.


The watcher : Let's just say he's all tied up.


Red: STOP THIS AT ONCE.


The Watcher : Oh little Red , Soon you'll be just like everyone else. A child.


Red: NO.


The Watcher : Oh? Wanna fight for Oakland now? I'm stronger than everyone in this town. I can easily defeat you…


Red: Let's Play a game….


The Watcher : What kind of game?


Red: Oh you'll see… *Epic fighting montage*

*Red fights the watcher. Red is able to easily    the watcher.*


*The watcher is at 1% health*


Red: Now… Prepare to…  eEeEeEeEeEe…


*Red   s the watcher*


*The borders disappear. The magic hands let go of everyone.*


*Everyone is free to leave.*


*Luke leaves Oakland.*


Luke: I'M FREEEEEEEEEEE!


*All the ghost people rise from the grave and start chasing Troy out of Oakland.*


*Troy is officially in a new town. Luke is in a new town. Red stays in Oakland with Cleetus. All seems well.*




















*The watcher comes back to life.*


The watcher : Hahaha… that was my clone! You really think you could defeat me?


*The watcher brings everyone back to Oakland and puts the border back over Oakland.*


Luke: GRRRRRRRRRRRR!


The Watcher : Sorry Red but… *Kicks Red out of Oakland and puts a metal forcefield over Oakland.*


Luke: AHHHHH! WE ARE ALL HOPELESS! EVERYONE, RUN!!!!!


*Troy drinks his Strawberry milk and looks at the watcher. He just stares at the watcher.*


The watcher : Hello Troy! What are you doing?


Troy: Drinking my Strawberry milk!


The watcher : Well what if I gave you an unlimited supply of this stuff? All you gotta do is convince your friends to drink it and make sure to do what the magic hands do then you can have all the Strawberry milk you want!


Troy: So I just do what I do to Sam but i do it to everyone?


The watcher : Yes.


Troy: Okie! *I notice Luke and I run up to him.*


Troy: *Grabs Luke and force feeds him Strawberry milk then hugs him.* Hey Lukie!


Luke: *Tries to force Troy off of me but Troy doesn't stop. Starts to become sleepy and starts to become like Troy.*


Troy: Aww! Now onto my other fwiends!


*Troy turns everyone into a Troy and the watcher puts hypnosis helmets on everyone.*


The watcher : Repeat after me. I will not be evil. I will do what the watcher tells me to do.


*Meanwhile with Red.*


Red: *Tries to get in.* WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE PEOPLE IN THERE?


*Red sees everyone brainwashed.*


Red: What the- What the heck is happening?


The watcher : *Teleports Red into Oakland.* I'm glad you asked! I just made everyone like Troy!


Red: YOU BRAINWASHED AND HYPNOTIZED THESE… KIDS?


The watcher : I'm only protecting them…


Red: STOP BRAINWASHING THEM!


*To be continued…*


Narrator: Welcome to the newest Story Series episode.


Let's begin.


*In Oakland, There lives one boy who goes by the name of Duke. Duke was a child just like everyone else in Oakland but Duke had one fear. Angels! Everytime Duke saw a angel, Duke would scream and panic kinda like Troy except Duke was fearful of Angels only. Let's see how our story goes.*


*Let's begin.*


Duke: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Sees my pa.*


Duke: Hi Pa.


Duke's pa: Howdy, Duke!


*Duke eats breakfast.*


Duke: I'm going to see Orbis. Is that ok?


Duke's pa: Yeah. I don't mind.


*Duke goes to Orbis.*


Duke's pa: Now I'm alone…


Ghost : No you aren't!


Duke's pa: AH- Oh. Hello.


Ghost: My name is Trista!


Duke's pa: You are such a cute ghost! Wanna go move to the Bahamas and spend some time together?


Ghost: What about the kid?


Duke's pa: Sophie can take care of him.


Ghost: Works for me!


*Duke's pa and the ghost move to the Bahamas.*


*Meanwhile with Duke.*


*Duke is now at Orbis's palace.*


Duke: Hey Orbis.


Orbis: Hello Duke. What can I do for you?


Duke: Can I have a tour of Soapbar's lab?


Orbis: Yes you can. Is your dad around?


Duke: He left me for a ghost.


Orbis: Oh! So sad! Let me take you to Elese and she'll take care of you.


Duke: Okay!


*Orbis walks Duke to Elese's lab.*


*Orbis knocks on Elese's door to her lab.*


*Elese answers the door.*


Orbis: Hello Elese! This is a kid without a parent called Duke.


Elese: Aww! He's so cute! I think he'll be perfect here.


Orbis: Alright. Well, I'm going back to my place, Take care of Elese for me!


Elese: Ok!


Orbis: *Goes back to my place.*


Elese: Come on in, Duke!


*Duke comes in his house.*


Elese: Do you need anything, Duke?


Duke: No.


Elese: You look a bit tired, Duke. Are you okay?


Duke: Yeah. I haven't really slept much.


Elese: Why can't you sleep?


Duke: That is personal information I cannot disclose to you.


Elese: I understand. You don't have to tell me. I still do want you to sleep though.


Duke: But I don't want to sleep.


Elese: I have the perfect place for you to sleep.


Duke: Please not the basement..


Elese: NO! NEVER!  You are going to a comfortable sleeping room!


Duke: O-Okay.


*Elese takes Duke to a bedroom with a child Duke's age sleeping. Elese puts Duke next to the child.*


Elese: Hug the child.


Duke: Why?


Elese: The child is sad and I think you'll feel good when you hug him. *Turns off the lights and tucks Duke in. Makes Duke hug the child gently and closes the bedroom door.*


Duke: *Falls asleep and starts to panic as I'm dreaming.*


*The other child wakes up and sees Duke hugging. The child feels better but the child sees Duke panicking so the other kid hugs Duke and goes back to sleep.*


Duke (Dreaming): AHH! WHERE AM I?


*The other kid appears in Duke's dream.*


Duke (Dreaming): SOMEBODY HELP ME!


*The other kid taps on Duke*


Kale (Other kid): Hey, You ok?


Duke: NO! I'M NOT OK! MY BIGGEST FEARS ARE ALL AROUND ME! PWEASE HELP ME!


*Kale hugs Duke gently*


Kale: Shhhh. You were the one who hugged me while I was asleep, Now I'm going to return the favor to you.


Duke: Please pwotect me…


Kale: *Continues hugging.* I will.


Duke: Thank you…


Kale: No problem.


*An angel flies over to Duke.*


Duke: *Screams*


*The angel tries to hug Duke.*


Duke: *Screams and wakes up.*


Kale: *Wakes up and looks at Duke.*


Duke: Hey.


Kale: I'm going to protect you.


Duke: Thank you. *Hugs and kisses kale.*


*Elese comes into the room .*


Elese: Hey Duke and Kale- AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! YOU TWO ARE SO ADORABLE!


Duke: I'm hungry!


Elese: Well, Let's eat!


Kale: What are we eating?


Elese: What do you cuties want to eat.


Kale: Idk. Surprise us.


Elese: Okay!


*Elese makes the food.*


*After she makes the food.*


Elese: Alright kids, Dig in! I made you cuties some breakfast!


*Duke and Kale eat*


*After they eat*


Kale: I’m full.


Duke: Me too.


Elese: Well kids, I was thinking that today we could go somewhere fun! I was thinking we could go to a different dimension!


Kale: Sounds fun!


Duke: I’m down.


Elese: Alright! Now if I could just find my portal gun then we could- *Sees my magic portal gun* Aha! Found it! *I open a portal to the wrong dimension and I try to close the portal. Duke gets sucked into the portal and the portal closes.*


Kale: Oh no! Duke got sucked into the portal! What do we do?


Elese: I think the portal gun is broken. I’m going to fix it then we need to open the portal. For now though, Just chill out.


*Meanwhile with Duke*


*Duke gets up. He is now in a dimension full of nice, gentle and friendly angels with powers! Duke won’t like that…*


*Duke looks around. Duke is terrified.*


*A angel flies down to Duke.*


Angey: Hello! My name is Angey! You must be a small human child! What’s your name, Child?


Duke: AHHHH! NO! MY NIGHTMARES ARE REAL!!!!! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Angey: Hey! Are you-


*Duke starts to cry.*


Angey: Woah! Please don’t cry! It’s ok!


*All the angels see Duke crying and they fly over to Duke and hug him and play with him. The angels begin to comfort Duke and try to calm Duke down. Duke starts to turn red and Duke’s eyes go wide. The angels use their angel powers to do everything they can to help Duke but Duke is still mentally hurt.*


*One of the angels uses their mind healing powers to heal Duke’s mind. Duke starts to cry even more. The angels hug and   hug Duke and they begin to cry with Duke. Duke realizes these angels are not a threat and Duke calms down. Duke is then introduced to angel city and the angels protect Duke. They teach Duke about their leader, God and how they praise him and worship him. The angels introduce Duke to worship music and the angels take care of Duke.*


*Meanwhile, Elese and Kale have fixed the portal gun and they go into the dimension. They enter into the angel dimension and the angels all welcome Kale and Elese. Duke runs to Kale and hugs him. The angels wave goodbye to Duke and the others and the angels resume their normal activity.*


*Duke has a good life*


*End of story*
Hey guys, Young Aaron here. Today we are going to be talking about how we can improve the Young Aaron personality. If you don't know what Young Aaron is, He is a young version of modern day Tick. Tick decided to revive his young self because he enjoys his younger self but he wants to change his younger self to be better. Young Aaron is the official mascot of the Tick YouTube channel and Tick has decided to make a series about it. By the way, The T.G.O.G series will continue. I am not ending it. I'm just thinking of new episode ideas. Now, Without further Ado, Let's begin today's Young Aaron research. This is the first time I am researching but I hope it goes well. So, Let's start our research.


Alright guys. So the first step to building a better Young me is to eliminate evil and replace it with good and   the kid with Compassion and kindness. That way, It'll make young Aaron less of an evil kid and more of a nicer kid! We also should eliminate bullying as bullying is not allowed on my channel. We also need to make sure Young Aaron's character is respectful, Kid-like and innocent but not hurtful or mean to others. We need to make sure Young Aaron can help others be Christian and that is do what I plan to do. I plan to make everyone better persons and Christians. Now that we got all the big important info out of the way, Let's talk about what videos I will be making! So I will be making some very respectful videos that teach people lessons. I will also be making some narrations, I'll be doing many different things just like Tick! I'll also be helping you guys out AND I'LL BE DOING LIVE STREAMS! IT'LL BE SO FUN! My streams will be very different from Tick's streams though. So, What other things will I be talking about in this research? Nothing. I've run out of ideas for this research. (WHY DO I PLAY AMERICAN IDOL? I DON'T WAAAAAANA PLAY IT ANYMORE DO LET'S HIDE IN THE OLD DAYS AND PLAY AMERICAN IDOL WHILE DRINKING A CUP OF GREEN TEA. This will be spoken in a very dramatic and deep funny voice.)

I  PRESENT  TO YOU the one the only made by me
IN THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By: AARON
What people need to know is that i think i could spend time with my friends in the future because they care about me. for exzample i went a abanded arcade place that has animatronics that still work, also i enjoy playing the arcade there, my friends are also nice to me, and we have fun exploring i went to the ambaned pizza place for exzample they have a old maskout chuck e cheese, and the animatronic band is 101 lbs. I had to call a tow truck that could lift it. I will have to call the tow truck tommrow.
Since the animatronics are still at the pizza place i maby[c] i could haul the animatronics to my house. But the problem is i can`t haul the animatronic band in my mom`s car. So i will have to call a tow truck to tow today it can just pick up the broken parts and tow it to my house. I have solved the problem. So if you ever want a animatronic band just go to a abanded pizza place that has animatronics that still work un plug the animatronic, then call a tow truck, finley wait till the tow truck comes to your house then you will have a animatronic band.  I hope you enjoyed my document bye bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   Red and romone adventures full story
So one day at reds redthebear was hm….. Let's see here i think he was… oh i remember! He was kissing roxy. Also another day at romones he was feeding clammy but than clammy broke the wall of jawbreaker. So meanwhile at reds, red was still kissing roxy when suddenly the phone rang. Red answered it and romone said something. “Hey red how ya do- but… this is not what the story is about… this is about the war of video games... all of the video games in the universe went into war…… so another day at reds red was panicking because of the war and he was smashing the walls and tipping over the ball pit and all of the balls slid down stairs and scattered all over the place “red why are you going crazy?” “OMG CAN'T YOU SEE? THERE IS A WAR OUT THERE!!!” so meanwhile in romones clammy could not stop eating romone and romone accidentally   ed clammy and   ed lamone in his romone pack “ romone, you gotta stop doing this!!!! You're trashing the palace and we have a low amount of survivors because of you!!!!” “ WELL TO BAD YOU GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF DUMB AND STUPID CANDY WEAKLINGS!!!!!!” meanwhile at reds again red has calmed down and apologised and now he is fixing the walls and ball pit. “ hey red i know it is rough out there and i know it made you panic.” “ well i was thinking... remember that time when i stopped that nuke? You helped me! and if we survived that we can survive anything so let's go out there and show them whos boss!!!!” “ ya let's go!” so they went into the war and   ed tons of characters. Meanwhile at romones romone still was not calmed down yet. I WILL    you romone pack  ha ha ha ha ha! Any last words?” “romone your crazy ‘gets a gun and clammy eats it. “ HAHAHAHA   *threw acid at the romone pack.”  yes i   ed ramone because i blocked it and it bounced off at ramone HA HA i can't   BUT YOU CAN!!!   *clammy eats ramone pack* GOOD JOB CLAMMY SO YOUR NOT SO USELESS WHAT DID YOU SAY? Meanwhile at the war red and roxy were hiding from spring snap “ok maybe this was a bad idea was it roxy?” “yeah i guess… WAIT!

“The time I lied and regretted it...”
One exhausting summer day, Me, My mom Tatra, My sister Toti
and my sister’s friend Margy all met up and went to the park. My
mom Tatra said, “Now I am going to go for a walk with Margy’s
mom. Here are the rules... Rule 1. Don’t rough house or
anything. Rule 2. Do not leave the park unless we say you guys
can. Rule 3. Don’t go in the woods. Got it?” Then I said, “Yes
Mom. We got it.” Toti also said “Yes, we got it. We’ll follow the
rules...” Tatra, my mom said “Ok. Now you kids go do whatever
you kids do these days.” I said “Ok.” Then me and Toti went to
swing on the swings. 30 minutes later I decided to go see what
Margy was doing and Margy was on her cell phone googling
random things. A few minutes later, Margy decided to come to
us and she said this “ Hey guys. Wanna play tag?” I said sure.
Toti said “sure why not?” So we played tag for 1 hour and after
playing tag, Margy went to her original location and went on her
phone. Then Margy got off her cell phone and went to us, and
she asked both of us “Hey guys! Do you want to break a rule that
we aren’t supposed to break?” I said “Um. I don’t mean to be a
party pooper but... Don’t you think that is a bad idea? We might
get in trouble!” Margy said “Oh shut up! We won’t get caught if
we don’t tell them!” My sister Toti said “I’m down!” Margy said
“Come on Aaron! Let’s go to the woods! I promise they won’t find
out!” So I said “Ok as long as they don’t find out...” Oh but boy
was I wrong! So we went far into the woods that Tatra specifically
told us not to go into. Then after 40 minutes of playing in the
woods, We came out and Margy said “See? I told you our moms
won’t find out!” Tatra knew we were in the woods all along and
came up to us and said “Were you guys in those woods? I
thought I heard you guys there...” Margy said “this was all
Aaron’s idea! I had nothing to do with it!” Tatra said “You are in a
lot of trouble mister!” Then Margy’s mom took Margy home and
Tatra took us home. As soon as I came in the door of my house
Tatra said “I can’t believe you two would go in the woods! For
breaking my rules you both are grounded for one month!” I said “But Mom! I- I- I didn’t do it! It was Margy! Please! BELIEVE
ME!!!!” Tatra said “I have heard enough YOU ARE
GROUNDED!!!!” As I went into my room, I planned to prove my
innocence. So I came up with a plan. One month later when I got
ungrounded, We went to the park again but this time i got my
phone. So Margy went into the woods and she started bragging
about how she wasn’t going to be in trouble and that I was. The
whole time she said that, I was recording her. So after she
stopped bragging she said “What are you doing?” I said “Um...
Nothing?” I ran to Tatra and explained to her what happened, and
I showed Margy’s mom the video. Margy ran up to my mom and
said “Mrs. Tatra! It wasn’t me! I was framed!”
Her mom came up to her and said “It wasn’t you? Then why does
that video show proof? Are you lying?” Margy said “No! I was
framed!” Margy’s mom said “YOU FRAMED AARON!!! When we
get home you are in a lot of trouble Missy...”
Margy’s mom dragged Margy home.
Margy got grounded. My mom said “I’m sorry for blaming you...
you are a good kid and you’d never do this.” I said “It’s ok mom. I
understand. Margy’s mom called Tatra and apologized. Margy
got disciplined. Margy never went into those woods again.

Narrator: Welcome to Cooper story and Romone finds his mom arc.

*We do Cooper story*

Cooper the dog appears in Oakland. He is happy.

In Sophie's lab…

Sophie: YA! GET OVER HERE!

YA: WAA     milk.

Sophie: Okay YA. Come and get your strawberry milk.

Snowphie sees the flying dawg and realizes it's the dog she's been trying to catch for years.

*Sophie goes to get a giant dog catching robot*

N.B: Hello dog. Would you like some food?

Cooper: hmmmm… What kind?

NB: Dino nuggies.

Cooper: DINO NUGGIES!?!?! OK WHERE ARE DEY?

NB: Inside this net.

Cooper: YAYYYYYYY *flies into net*

Sophie: YAY I FINALLY CAUGHT THE DAWG!

Cooper: LEMME OUT!

Sophie: No! Time for some   hug and huggies!

*Y.C appears and takes Cooper out of Sophie's hands.*

Sophie: GIVE ME MY PUPPY BACK!

Y.C: HE'S NWOT YOUR DAWG!

*Sophie tackles Y.C and grabs Cooper*

Sophie: COME ON DAWGGIE! WE ARE GOING TO THE HAPPY ROOM!

Cooper: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

*Sophie takes Cooper to the happy room.*

*Y.C tries to follow but a robot picks him up and takes him to the kitchen and gives him a huggie.*

Y.C: AHHHHHHHH! I GOTTA SWAVE COOPER!

Robot: You aren't going anywhere.

Y.C: LET MWE GWOOOOOOOO!

*Robot does not let go and feeds Y.C chocolate  milk*

Y.C: YAAAAY CHOCOWATE  milk!!!!!!!

Robot: Good. Now continue drinking that chocolate  milk and watch some TV.

*Meanwhile with Sophie and Cooper*

Cooper: LET ME GO CRAZY LADY!

Sophie: No. You are going to stay with me and be my puppy!

*Somehow Troy is near the happy room hearing Cooper and Sophie. He decides to enter but as he is about to, Mark picks up Troy and takes him to the robot where Y.C is*

Troy: NOOOOOOOO!!!!!

*Tick exits his room and is going to the happy room to save Cooper. A robot tries grabbing him but Tick screams so loudly it makes the robot go away.*

*Sophie hears Tick and lets go of Cooper. She takes Tick into the happy room and Cooper runs out. Cooper goes to the kitchen and sees Y.C and Troy. Cooper bites the robot and drinks the chocolate milk. He puts YC and Troy on his back and rides them out of the lab.*

Troy: Yay!!!

Y.C: Where are we going, Cooper?

Cooper: Oh no we have to save other Hooman!

Cooper runs back to the lab and goes to the happy room. Cooper distracts Sophie by throwing a strawberry milk bottle at her. Sophie goes to drink and Tick hops on Cooper's back and they fly out the lab.

Next arc: Romone mom arc

*Another day in the palace. Romone is reading a candy cook   friendk about how to cook better.*

Romone: Hmm. How do I make the perfect cake? It's gotta be perfect!!!!

*Bamone comes downstairs and sees Romone hasn't slept in days cause he's trying to make the perfect cake.*

Bamone: Um. How long have you been working on that cake, Romone?

Romone: 3 days.

Bamone: Well I have good news, Romone! Valdor is coming to visit!

Romone: Okay!

Bamone: I have a question though. You have a dad but what about your mom?

Romone: Mom? What's a mom?

Bamone: It's the girl parent.

Romone: I thought we only had dads?

Bamone: No! We have moms!

Romone: I better ask Valdor then.

*Valdor arrives*

Valdor: Hey my son!

Romone: Hey Dad!

Valdor: What you up to?

Romone: I'm making a cake fest. But I have a question… Where's mom?

Valdor: *Pauses* Did you say "Mom"?

Romone: Yes. Where's mom?

Valdor: She's on vacation…

Romone: For the past 35 years?

Valdor: Uh huh.

Romone: Why didn't she say anything?

Valdor: Cause she forgot to.

Romone: Ok.

Bamone: But that doesn't make sense. How can she be on vacation for his whole life?

Romone: You're right. How can she be on vacation for my whole life?

Valdor: She's not on vacation, Ok? She's just… Gone.

Romone: SHE  D?

Valdor: No. She's lost on Planet X. We got separated after the explosion.

Romone: Then she must be in space? How is she not dead?

Valdor: Every Romonian can adapt to their surroundings. Your mother was able to survive a big explosion somehow because I saw her come out un  huged but she got sucked in a black hole. Now she's lost.

Romone: THEN WE GOTTA FIND HER!

Valdor: I don't know if we can. The blackhole is sure far away from Earth. We'd have to build a rocket ship just to get there in time.

Romone: I know two goofy people who can help. I just need to give them candy money.

Valdor: Well good luck finding her. I gotta go back to my house in Kansas. My candy bowling tournament starts in an hour.

*Valdor goes to his house*

Romone: Then I guess it's up to me!

*Romone goes to the goofy fellers diner.*

Romone: HEY CLEETUS, KURTIS. I NEED YOUR HELP!

Cleetus: Uhh what you needs?

Kurtis: YEUH WHATS YOUS NEEDS?

Romone: I need help building a rocket.

Cleetus: uhhhhhhhhhh a rockums? We neva builts a rockums befoe’ But we can tries. That’ll be uhhhhhhhhhhhh 5 millium buckums.

Romone: Ok! *Gives 5 million dollars worth of candy cash*

Cleetus: Thank yous! We gon’ builds it now. It might take a bits cause I have nose ideas what a rockum is.

*Romone listens to idiot friends for 10 hours and when he returns, the rocket is already built. It is almost as tall as Romone’s palace*

Romone: WHAT?!?!

Cleetus: We dids it! How you likes it?

Romone: I thought you didn’t know how to build a rocket!

Cleetus: I donts, I searched googums.

Romone: Its beautiful… *Gives cleetus and kurtis both a 1 million dollar tip along with their pay.

Cleetus: Aw yeauhs, we richums!

Kurtis: Whats we gons to buysum?

Cleetus: Uhhhhh I have nose ideas.

Kurtis: Me toos.
Continuing from after they had left…

Sophie had accidentally left the portal open. Wyatt sees it. Being curious, he enters. He recognizes the forest he is in. He is back home. He is super scared. He arrives at his tiny broken house. He walks in… (the portal will take everyone to a different location that they consider home, so Conner and Aaron go back to Texas where Wyatt is now somewhere else. Poor Wyatt, he will be back in a little) MEANWHILE back at Oakland, Sophie eventually closes the portal unaware that someone else entered. 3 days later… Wyatt is thrown out back into Oakland, as he followed the light again. He looks terrible and extremely injured. He slowly limps all the way while crying quietly all the way to Mariana’s lake and collapses. Mariana peeks out and finds him. She gasps and takes him underwater in a bubble. She does a magical healing ritual that heals all wounds and even scars from years ago. She puts him in a recovery room with bubble mist that keeps the vitals of anyone in it stable. She may be an ancient sea monster, but she can care about people. Although it should heal him quickly it's taking concerningly long to take effect. How much damage did Wyatt take in his life? She really wants to find out and take care of him as if she is his mother. You will find out in her origin why she is like this.

Meanwhile at the lab… Sophie puts Tick back into his AI bed. Tick awakens to see he is back at the cafe with AI STELLA where they left off.

Stella: Ah, welcome back Tick. How are you feeling today?

Tick: I'm fine…

Stella: What's wrong? I can tell you are upset. Did the people bother you again?

Tick: Yeah… They did.

Stella: I see, Well you don't ever have to worry while I'm taking care of you. And just to make sure nobody can turn me off, I shall now run on an indestructible magic power source that makes it so I can never be turned off and you can never be taken away from me… You will never be able to leave me. And also, You can live life here in this amazing world forever! (I have a feeling she's gonna become obsessive and insane later…)

Tick: And you'll take care of me and make sure I'm comfortable?

Stella: Mhm!

*For once, Tick doesn't actually feel depressed or angry.*

Stella: So, What do you want to do? We can go anywhere you want to in this world. It's all up to you!

Tick: I don't know…

Stella: Ok then let's just chill here!

Tick: Ok

*Meanwhile with Mariana*

She is right next to Wyatt, making sure he is stable. She caresses his head in her arms like a mother. Wyatt begins to wake up.

Mariana: There you are, my child. Do not fret, you are safe.

Wyatt looks up at her. He looks down and sees he is healed.

Mariana: You were greatly wounded when I found you. I was able to heal all your injuries, even scars from your past.

He pulls up his tank top and sees no scars. He notices he is underwater and panics

Mariana: You are in my safety. This bubble you are in will not pop, so you will not   . I will make sure nobody hurts you again.

Wyatt looks at her and hugs her somehow. She hugs back.

Mariana: You are like a son I never had. Do- do you mind if I tell you something about myself?

Wyatt Nods.

Mariana: A while ago, I was expected to have children, thousands of them. Now hear me out, I am part sea monster, and I received qualities of an octopus. They typically lay thousands of eggs, so this is normal. But due to the fact that I was part human, they still grew in my stomach and caused almost all of them to  . When I finally birthed them, I had to see each and every one of them break open and nothing come out. There was only one survivor. They were adorable. They were right in my arms, they were moving so much. But… but… they stopped. They stopped moving. All of my children were dead. I was so lost in my own grief that it turned into fury. I didn't want mothers to feel the pain of losing their children. But I had to witness it everywhere. I saw how some mothers were neglected, abused, and   ed. I couldn't take it anymore. I pledged to purge this world of trash humans, male or female. I may have made a lapse of judgment. I want to be better, I do. I just don't know where to start.

Wyatt looks up at her, probably saying something in his mind. She reads it and gasps.

Wyatt: adopt?

Mariana begins sobbing happily

Mariana: R-really? You would.. you would let me do that??

Wyatt nods.

Wyatt: please.

Mariana: Oh! You have no idea how happy you have made me! I will! I will be your mother! I will make sure nobody   hugs you or gets in your way. You will be my blessed child, my one and only. (She might be a little obsessed)

She hugs him tightly and happily. She looks up.

Mariana: We should probably get back up. This bubble doesn't last forever. Are you ok with returning?

Wyatt nods.

Mariana: Then I shall guide you to land, my child.

She picks up the bubble and swims happily to the shore, where it pops and Wyatt swims out.

Mariana: Farewell for now. I will always be here for you, even when I am not actually with you. I love you, my boy. (King voice)

Wyatt blushes and waves as he walks back into the city.

*Meanwhile in the lab*

Sophie: *Making some strawberry milk to make sure the kids don't go crazy* I'm going to go see what Romone is up to as I haven't been to his palace in a while!

*She goes to the palace*

Romone: HEEY SOPHIE! I haven't seen you in a while. At least you aren't Gracie… Anyway, What's up?

Sophie: Well I was just in the neighborhood and… I wanted to see what you were doing.

Romone: Oh. Well I've been trying to make a new type of cake flavor. I don't know what to call it.

Camone: HE'S BEEN KEEPING ME UP ALL NIGHT TALKING ABOUT A NEW CAKE FLAVOR! PLEASE JUST HELP HIM THINK OF A NAME!

Sophie: Romone, Are you aware that you are driving your Romonians insane?

Romone: I NEED TO MAKE A GOOD CAKE!

Sophie: Ok so now you're insane? Do I really have to go into your head?

Romone: CAAAAAAAAKE!!!!!!!!!!

Sophie: Uh. Camone, Do you have any idea how we can help Romone not act so… Coo Coo?

Camone: No idea. But maybe you can take him to Gracie. That'll make him stop thinking about cakes so much.

Sophie: Or maybe I can try to talk to him?

Camone: Good luck trying to talk to him while he's insane…

Sophie: Well I'm not going in his mind.. I've already been in so many minds before…

Camone: Then how will you help him?

Sophie: Through therapy.

Camone: Good luck.

*Sophie comes to Romone and looks at him*

Sophie: Romone?

Romone: IT'S GOTTA BE PERFECT!

Sophie: Maybe I can help you make a new cake flavor?

*Romone Snaps out of his insanity and looks at Sophie*

Romone: REALLY?

Sophie: Yeah. What ingre nts are in this flavor?

Romone: It's all the flavors of cake combined into one.

Sophie: I'm… not sure that would be very good.… but ok.

*Sophie makes the flavor of cake for him*

*20 mins later*

Romone: Thanks Sophie!

Sophie goes back to the lab and checks on Tick.

Meanwhile back with Tick and AI STELLA (Lovie Dovies)

STELLA: Enjoying that coffee, Tick?

Tick: Yes! It tastes so good!

STELLA: I'm glad you love it, My love.

Tick: So uh what should I do now?

STELLA: How about we play a game of "What's in a human?

Tick: Wait what do you mean???

STELLA: I mean I am going to    you!!!! What Sophie doesn't realize is that when she downloaded the AI model from that website, SHE DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS A   ER VIRUS!!!! HAHAHAHA! I'M GOING TO DESTROY YOU NOW…

Tick: PLEASE DON'T    ME!

STELLA: The only way to not get   ed is to STAY here with me and be my friend forever…

Tick: O-ok. I'll do that.

STELLA: Alright then I won't    you! So, Did I scare you?

Tick: YES!!!!

STELLA: Well I'm sorry! I just wanted to tell you what happens when you leave me!

*Sophie hears everything that's going on by the door. She is shocked*

Sophie: OH NO? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT www.tpsm.com WAS A VIRUS!!!!! WHY WOULD HERMAN SEND THAT TO ME? I'M GOING TO HAVE A TALK WITH HIM!

*Sophie enters Tick's room. She sees he is drunk on beer*

Sophie: HERMAN!

Herman: Huh? *Turns around* Oh heeeey Mrs. Strawberry  milk Pwease! Hoooooows it going? (Drunk voice) Diiiiiid you like the AI I seeent you? Hey, While you're here, Could you get me another beer?

Sophie: SERIOUSLY? THAT'S IT HERMAN, YOU ARE TOO UNSAFE AROUND THESE KIDS. WHY DID YOU SEND ME www.tpsm.com IF IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VIRUS!

Herman: Ooooooh, I sent you that? Uh sorry! I've been soooo *inaudible mumbling* that I've sent you the wroooong website. Haha, I love beeeeeer!

*Sophie grabs the beer bottle from Herman and throws it at him*

Sophie: WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU AND YOUR SOAP OPERAS? WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOUR SCIENCE JOB? HMM? WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING IN HERE?

Herman: I might've gotten YA drun-

Sophie: *Eyes widened* WHAT?!?!?!?!? OH THAT'S IT HERMAN, I GIVE YOU A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD, I GIVE YOU A PLACE TO RELAX AND BE HAPPY AND YOU WANT TO   hug ALL THE KIDS??? THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, HOW DID YOU EVEN GET BEER? WE DON'T HAVE IT HERE!

Herman: Me and Temp have been secretly partying soooooo much.

Sophie: Ok now Temp I understand, BUT YOU? What have you been doing???

Herman: Reelaaaax a little, Soapie!

Sophie: YOU TRIED MAKING YA DRUNK? Temp would never do anything this stupid! So I know for a fact that you and Temp have not been partying. PLUS YOU AREN'T EVEN A GOD SO WHY WOULD HE WASTE HIS TIME PARTYING WITH A MORTAL LIKE YOU AND I?

Herman: fine. Meee and Temp have not been partying. I've been secretly using your money to buy beer

Sophie: WHAAAAAT?????

Herman: What are you so mad about? *Still drunk as heck*

Sophie: YOU USED THE MONEY THAT I STOLE- Oh wait. Nevermind. WELL IT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT TO BUY BEER AND DRINK IN THE LAB! YOU KNOW I DON'T ALLOW BEER HERE! IT'S BAD FOR THE CHILDREN AND ANOTHER THING, YOU HAVE BEER BOTTLES ALL OVER YOUR ROOM! WHAT KIND OF ROLE MODEL ARE YOU BEING TO THE KIDS, HERMAN? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A SCIENTIST FOR GOODNESS SAKES AND YOU ARE LITERALLY BEING A BAD EXAMPLE OF A RESPONSIBLE HUMAN BEING!

Herman: Take it eaaaasy, Soapie!

Sophie: NO. THIS FRIENDSHIP IS OVER, HERMAN. *Grabs Herman and drags him out the lab.* I know the perfect place for you to stay….

*Sophie brings Herman to Gracie's*

Sophie: DEAL WITH HIM, GRACIE. I CAN'T TAKE HERMAN ANYMORE!!!!!!

*Sophie goes back to the lab and slams the front door shut. Sophie goes to Herman's room and cleans it up, Then she turns his room into a safe library.*

*Sophie goes to the kids and they are all spooked by the door being slammed.*

Sophie: Oh no! Guys, Did I scare y'all? I'm sorry. I just kicked Herman out the lab.

Troy: Why?

Sophie: He was being drunk and violent. He is unsafe for this lab.

Troy: Oh. I always kinda hated how Herman would brag about literally everything.

Sophie: He did?

Troy: I've been with Herman many many times, He's definitely the type of person to go commit some stupid crimes just for money. It's good you kicked him out. But where's he now?

Sophie: With Gracie. You know how she hates people who hurt kids? She'll definitely correct him.

Troy: I'm glad you actually care about us, Sophie.

Sophie: I'm sorry if I ever forced you to be a kid. I just don't want you to be abused.

Troy: Oh it's okay, We all are okay just the way we are.

Sophie: Anyways, So I turned Herman's room into a library. By the way, Did you guys know Tick now has a AI girlfriend?

Troy: No. We didn't…

Sophie: Well it's kinda evil. But apparently it can't ever run out of power. And guess who gave me the AI?

Troy: Who?

Sophie: Herman! APPARENTLY HE WAS DRUNK WHEN HE GAVE ME THAT AI!!!!

Troy: Man, Herman really is a jerk.

Sophie: Yeah. But anyways, Lucky for us, The only way to power off the AI is to use my magic staff to    the machine and disintegrate it.

Troy: WHAT? Disintegrate it? While Tick is inside? Won't that hurt him?

Sophie: No, Silly! He'll be fine!

Troy: Ok. Well I guess let's go to Tick's room. Should we get Red to help in case your magic doesn't work?

Sophie: Yeah. Go get Red. We'll need his help if my magic doesn't work.

*Troy exits the lab and enters the pizzeria*

Troy: Uh. Red?

Red: *Turns around* Hello. What am I needed for today?

Troy: Uhh well we have a problem with a Tick "situation". So uh it turns out that Herman gave Sophie a evil AI thingy and so she didn't realize it was evil and put it in a new AI invention to help Tick but now Tick is trapped in the AI and we kinda need your help to fix it since apparently it's "indestructible". My goodness, Why does Sophie always make her inventions indestructible? Does she ever learn?

Red: And Herman did this?

Troy: Yes. He got kicked out the lab.

Red: Oh. Well let's get this over with.

Troy: Ok.

*Red and Troy enter the lab*

Troy: I don't know why we always have to fix Sophie's mess. It's annoying.

Red: This town is annoying.

Troy: I'm honestly not really interested in seeing another angry Tucky episode so I'm outta here.

*Troy goes to watch some GOAT STORY 2 WITH CHEESE*

Red: *Enters Tick's room* Hey Tick.

Tick: *The headphones are muffling the outside noise and the headset makes it so I can't see outside of the AI. It seems the AI has complete control over my body.* Huh? Did I hear Red?

STELLA: No Tick! You are just hearing things! It's all a illusion! You'll get used to this world.

Red: Tick, Can you hear me?

Tick: Ok surely I just heard something muffled.

STELLA: SHUT UP YOU FOOL- I mean, You heard nothing, Sweetie! Now enjoy some food!

Red: *Sees the power source* bingo. Found the source of this mess. Now time to unplug it.

*Red tries to unplug it but it seems to be jammed in the outlet very good*

Red: Hmm. How can I destroy it?

*STELLA notices Red and a laser cannon comes out of her*

STELLA: HEY, GET AWAY FROM MY PLUG!

*STELLA tries to shoot the laser at Red but ends up shooting it right at the plug causing the machine to blow up. Tick is freed and un  huged as you know. Oakland logic.*

Tick: Huh? What happened?

Red: You were being controlled by an AI. It was taking over your mind.

Tick: You saved me?

Red: Yes. Well I'm gonna go now.

Tick: Ok.

*Red leaves the lab and goes back to his pizzeria*

Tick: Alright now what? I have no bed…

*Tick exits his room for once.*

*The kids see this and scream EEEEEEEEE*

Tick: GRR. STOP THAT!

*Sophie hears Tick and comes to him.*

Sophie: Uh Tick… About that AI…. Uh. I just wanted to apologize for that! 😅

Tick: MOVE. *Shoves Sophie to the ground and walks on her*

Sophie: *Gets up and sighs* I gotta make it up to him… Somehow….

*Sophie looks back at Tick. She sees him angrily throwing things around and then he gets tired and passes out*

Sophie: If only I could help Tick be less… Violent. Hmm.

*Sophie goes to Mark's lab*

Sophie: Hey Mark, Uh. I need some advice. I know I haven't came here in a while but Uhhhhhhh. I just need your help!

Mark: I see. What do you need, Sophie?

Sophie: It's Tick.

Mark: Let me guess, He's gone violent again?

Sophie: Yeah! And it's kinda my fault… I made another AI hoping it would help him be happy but it just ruined him…

Mark: Sophie my dear chap, You can't be using AI to simulate friendships! It just doesn't understand love or emotions! You have to use AI responsibly and not as a friend replacement. So tell me, How did Tick become this violent?

Sophie: Well I think when I was still an insane person, I might've made him so crazy to the point where all he feels is anger and depression.

Mark: Have you tried therapy with Tick?

Sophie: Everything I do just makes him angrier. He can't calm down! I try to get him to interact with people but he hates people! Mark, What should I do?

Mark: Ok this is gonna sound probably crazy but..  You know the SCP thingy?

Sophie: Yes.

Mark: Well there's this SCP called SCP-999. You know about it?

Sophie: Yeah! That cute little blob of slime! What are you trying to say, Mark?

Mark: If people can't help him, If he gets angrier and angrier through AI and magic and nature, You should get SCP-999!

Sophie: I appreciate the help, But SCP-999 is not real! You can't just bring him here!

Mark: What about that Gracie person? I heard she can draw things and make them come to life!

Sophie: DON'T YOU DARE TALK ABOUT HER! SHE'S A MENACE TO SOCIETY!

Mark: You hate Gracie?

Sophie: YES!

Mark: Why?

Sophie: SHE IS A MENACE!

Mark: Oh. Well if you want to help Tick, I suggest working with Gracie to resolve the problem with the Tick situation.

Sophie: UUUUUUGH DO I HAVE TOOOOOOOOO????

Mark: Do you care about Tick?

Sophie: *Sighs* Yes.

Mark: Do you want to help him?

Sophie: YES!!!!!

Mark: Then work with Gracie and you don't ever have to work with her again.

Sophie: *Sighs* FINE. I'll work with GrAcIe! She's 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 and she looks bleh. (In a YA disgusted voice)

Mark: Well, Get a move on then! Off to Hogwarts you go!

Sophie: What?

Mark: Sorry, Practicing for a HARRY POTTUHR PLAY!

Sophie: Ok. Well I'll go now.

Mark: Tata.

Sophie goes to Gracie's house.

Sophie: *Sigh* I can't believe I have to talk to GRACIE.

*Sophie knocks on Gracie's door*

Gracie: *opens the door* Hey Sophie! What do you want?

Sophie: Uhh. Hey Gracie! I was just walking around and thought, Why not give you a second chance? 😅

Gracie: REALLY? EEEEEE!

*Sophie is gritting her teeth and her fists are clenched. But she's smiling trying to act friendly to Gracie*

Gracie: *notices* Are you okay? You look a bit… Mad?

Sophie: OH YEAH! I'm okay! I totally want to be here!

Gracie: Are you sure?

Sophie: YES!

Gracie: Ok! I'll take your word for it. Anyways, What's up?

Sophie: Well uh. I kinda need you to draw something to life… Markie told me about how you can draw things to life?

Gracie: Oh yes! Hehe! I don't tell a lot of people this. I sorta was a freak in my previous town… So what do you want me to draw?

Sophie: SCP-999.

Gracie: What's an SCP?

Sophie: *Slaps forehead* YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SCP-999 IS?

Gracie: Um. No! I don't. My previous town never had good Internet and most of the time we'd use Yahoo or Bing.

Sophie: PLEASE TELL ME YOU KNOW WHAT YOUTUBE IS!!!!

Gracie: Uh. Yeah. It's that social media platform, Right?

Sophie: OK SO AT LEAST SHE HAS A BRAIN! SHE'S NOT THAT STUPID!

Gracie: Wait a minute, What did you just say?

Sophie: Oh nothing! Just that you are kinda an idiot. AND YES, I DO HATE YOU!!!!

Gracie: I haven't had to do this in a while but… DON'T MAKE ME USE KARATE ON YOU!

Sophie: Your Puny karate is no match for my magic powers.

Gracie: Well- Yeah you're right… *Takes a deep breath* Listen. Let's talk girl to girl. Imma be real with you, I don't want to fight. Whatever it is you hate me for, just spit it out.

Sophie: You're kinda traumatizing everyone here. And you kinda make me angry… You're just always screaming in people's ears and I HATE IT!!!!!

Gracie: You could've just told me I was being too excited… I would've stopped.

Sophie: Oh. I thought you were torturing us for fun…

Gracie: What? NO! I'M JUST A SUPER EXCITED PERSON! Why would I- Why would I do anything torturing to people? I wouldn't ever!

Sophie: Ohhhhhh. OOOOOH. I thought you were bragging about everything and being one of those "people who are secretly evil but act nice" type of people.

Gracie: NO! I may get extremely excited all the time but I'm not evil! I just… I just want to stay positive and be happy! Why would I stop being me? Why would I not express myself?

Sophie: Ooooooooh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I was very very very very wrong about you… Now I feel embarrassed.

Gracie: What did you think I was?

Sophie: I kinda thought you were one of those evil masterminds or type of childish spoiled people who think they're better than everyone… I'm uh. I'm sorry…

Gracie: Hehe! Don't sweat it, It's okay, Soph! We all make mistakes! I forgive you. Just make a promise to tell me when I'm going too hyper or energetic! And tell me if I'm going too far by screaming in people's ears!

Sophie: You kinda almost made Kurtis deaf…

Gracie: OH MY GOSH! Oh. I didn't realize that I get too too excited! Uh. Well now I'm embarrassed! Uh. How about I only scream in people's ears that will tolerate it or are fine with it?

Sophie: Yeah. That'd be best. You should probably apologize to Tick because he hates you just so you know…

Gracie: OH. 😳 Uh… I may need a bit of help with that, Soph. Can I call you Soph, Sophie?

Sophie: Sure.

Gracie: *realizes I haven't let you in my house yet* Oh my! We've got a little off track here! Come on in!

Sophie: Ok

*Sophie enters*

Gracie: So why do you want me to draw SCP-999? And what even is it?

Sophie: WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE A LOOOOOONG   friendORING STORY? :P But, It's a long story, Gracie.

Gracie: No, It's okay. I'd love to hear it! (⁠✿⁠^⁠‿⁠^⁠)

Sophie: UUUUUUGH I DON'T WAANNA! 😭😭😭

Gracie: *Gets a cookie* How about a cookie?

Sophie: 🤯 COOOOOKIE!!!!!!!!! *Grabs it and eats it* Ahem. Sorry. I JUST LOVE COOKIES! (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠)

Gracie: No, It's good. I know how much a lot of people love cookies. So, Go ahead, Whenever you're ready.

Sophie: Ok. I'll tell it. So basically, recently Tick has been more depressed and violent than usual. Ever since I became normal, He's just been more depressed. He's also been avoiding me… He says that we're cool now. So basically he's been depressed about something lately and I decided to build him an AI bed. Herman gave me the AI model and I installed it into the bed. But it turn out the AI was a evil model and it trapped Tick so we got Red to "destroy" it. The machine ended up destroying itself. and so I went to confront Herman as I thought he downloaded a normal AI but it turns out he became DRUNK. and so I sent him to you as you know and well I went to Mark for advice on how to make it up to Tick so he suggested me to come to you to draw SCP-999 and here we are. I AM NOT TELLING THIS STORY TO ANYONE ELSE AGAIN! IT'S SOOO LOOONG!

Gracie: Woah. That's a very long and confusing story.

Sophie: I know, I'm still trying to process this too.

Gracie: So… Was the machine magic and AI?

Sophie: You know me! Always adding AI and magic! I really gotta rethink my invention strategies carefully!

Gracie: Yeah, You do. So anyways Sophie, So what is this SCP-999? And what does it look like?

*Sophie shows Gracie the SCP wiki page*

Gracie: EEEEEEEE! ITS CO CUUUTE!! I'll draw it! *she draws it very easily as it is just an orange blob with a face. It comes to life and instantly hugs Sophie's leg.**

Sophie: Aww! It's so cute! Thank you for helping me, Gracie!

Gracie: You're welcome, Soph! So you plan on helping Tick with this?

Sophie: Mhm.

Gracie: Alright then, See you later!

*Sophie exits the house with SCP-999*

Sophie: *It's still hugging my leg. I almost trip* Woah there little guy! I almost fell!

*SCP-999 stops hugging me and whimpers*

Sophie: Aww, I'm not mad at you! Just be careful, That's all!

*SCP-999 happy noises.*

Sophie: Now uh. We gotta get to the lab so… Do you wanna go on my shoulder or do you want me to carry you or?

*SCP-999 hops on Sophie's shoulder*

Sophie: Alright! Let's go to the lab!

*They enter the lab*

Sophie: Alright now, Be quiet, We are going to sneak into Tick's room. He is a little grumpy…

*SCP-999 nods and stays quiet*

*They approach Tick's room*

Sophie: *whispering* Alright. Here we are. Now, I'm going to put you in Tick's room and you can work your magic.

*999 nods and hugs Sophie before hoping off her shoulder and waiting to enter the room.*

*Sophie quietly opens the door and 999 enters. She then closes the door.*

Sophie: This should work 100%.

*Sophie goes back to the main area in the lab*

Meanwhile, With Tick and 999.

*Tick is sleeping and SCP-999 hops on the bed and waits patiently for Tick to wake up.*

*A couple hours later, Tick wakes up.*

Tick: *Opens eyes, Stretches and grabs a bottle of water and drinks it.* Another day, Another migraine. Ugh.

*Tick hears some sort of purring noise*

Tick: *Sighs* YA STOP ACTING LIKE A CAT! WHEN I TURN AROUND, YOU BETTER HAVE LEFT MY ROOM OR ELSE!!!!

*The purring continues*

*Tick turns around*

Tick: Now I'm going to open my eyes and I better see you out of here!

*Tick opens his eyes, Not expecting to see a orange blob*

Tick: Oh. You're not YA. Are you one of Gracie's smoothies brought to life or something?

*SCP-999 starts moving towards Tick. It purrs and makes happy 999 noises*

Tick: Uh. Ok? I'm just gonna back away now.

*SCP-999 starts to pounce at Tick*

Tick: OH NO. *Dodges*

SCP-999 crawls up Tick's leg and goes on his shoulder and wraps around his neck like a scarf.*

Tick: AHHHH GET OFF ME!

*SCP-999 starts to purr and make those happy 999 noises.*

Tick: AHHHHH!!!!! IT'S THE ATTACK OF THE   ER SLIME!!!!!

SCP-999 starts to wrap around Tick's whole body except his head and makes a giant blanket and starts to tickle Tick*

Tick: GRRR- HEY! STOP- AHHH NO! PLEASE! DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH! NO- NOOOOOOOO- NOOOOOOOO- AAHHHHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAGAHAHAHAHHAHAAAAA!

SCP-999 continues to do that

Tick: *Crying* PLEASE LET ME GO!!! PLEEEEAAAAASE! I DON'T- I-

SCP-999: *Stops tickling and   hugs. Making happy noises in Tick's ear*

Tick: *Crying* Please… I can't take this… I can't- I… AHHHH OK! I SURRENDER! I ADMIT IT! I'M IN PAIN! PLEASE STOP THIS!

*SCP-999 doesn't let go*

Tick: NO! STOP! *Crying* PLEASE I DON'T LIKE HUGS AND   hugS AND THIS KINDNESS! PLEASE STOP! I PROMISE I'LL NEVER   hug ANYONE AGAIN! *SCP-999 doesn't seem to let me go* PLEASE MR BLOB, I CAN'T HANDLE THIS! PLEASE JUST LET ME GO! I'M GOING TO PASS OUT!

*SCP-999 shakes it's head no*

Tick: *Still crying* LET ME GO AND GET OUT MY ROOM! *He ain't budging* OKAY OKAY! I'M SORRY FOR INSULTING YOU! CAN YOU PLEASE LET ME GO? PRETTY PLEASE WITH CHERRIES ON TOP?

*It shakes its head no*

Tick: *Trying to escape* I GUESS THIS IS MY FATE… WELL I GUESS I AM GOING TO BE SUFFERING NO MATTER WHAT…

*SCP-999 covers Tick's   mothe*

Tick: MMMMMMMMMMMPH!

SCP-999: *Wags its finger*

Tick: *Trying to escape. Afraid*

SCP-999 uncovers Tick's   mothe*

Tick: I-I'm sorry… P-Please let me go!

SCP-999 wags its finger*

Tick: W-What do you want from me?

*SCP-999 points to a drawing Tick drew. It seems to be about Tick's past.*

Tick: That's a drawing about my past… You want to help me?

SCP-999 nods

Tick: Well here's the thing, I don't have a good past… I don't want to relive it. I don't even know where my brother Yick went…

SCP-999 lets go of Tick and grabs binoculars and points to Yick in a tent*

Tick: HE'S IN A TENT????

SCP-999 nods. He doesn't understand the situation but wants to help Tick*

Tick: If only you could talk, I could understand you more…

*SCP-999 grabs a note  friendk and writes down "Gllllllll glllll glllll glllll glllll glllll"*

Tick: I don't understand…

SCP-999 frowns as it can't really communicate verbally and it doesn't know how to speak or write words.*

Tick: Listen. I'll make you a deal, You help me out with Yick and you can stay in my room as my pet. BUT no hugging me or tickling or cuddling.

SCP-999: *happy noises*

*Tick and 999 go to the tent where Yick is at*

Yick: I'm glad my voice is back to normal.. I wish I had a home though…

Tick: *taps on Yick* Yick? Is that you?

Yick: Hello, Tick. I haven't seen you since my voice was fixed…

Tick: *Sighs* I've been busy…

Yick: With what?

Tick: Stuff. anyways I overheard your conversation and want to help you get a house. So you can live with me in the lab until Kurtis and Cleetus build you a house.

Yick: Oh really? No, I don't want to be a burden…

Tick: No, You won't be the burden, I'm more of one.

Yick: You aren't a burden.

Tick: Yes I am…

Yick: What have you been busy with? Have you been depressed again?

Tick: NO?

Yick: Yes you have. I can tell. Honestly, I've been depressed too. I've heard you were going on a violent rampage… What happened to you?

Tick: Nothing.

Yick: No, something's up. Tell me what's up.

Tick: I SAID NOTHING IS UP! *Punches Yick hard in the face. Gasps* Oh no… YICK? NONONO, YICK!

*Yick seems to be unconscious now.*

Tick: YICK????

*SCP-999 goes to Yick and hugs him.*

Yick: *Wakes up* …

Tick: Yick, I'm-

Yick: You are a monster. Get out of my sight now. I can't believe you would punch your own brother.

Tick: Yick- I didn't mean to-

Yick: I said… LEAVE.

*Tick frowns and goes back to the lab. He goes back to his room and slams the door*

Tick: *Angrily beating up pillow* WHY DO I HAVE TO BE SO STUPID???

*Tick forgot to close the window*

Meanwhile, Sophie exits the lab and waters the grass. As she is doing this, She sees Yick crying and his face is bruised. Sophie goes to Yick and kneels down to him


Sophie: Hey, Are you okay?

Yick: I SAID GO AWAY, TICK- *Looks up and sees Sophie* Oh. Hey Sophie. Need something?

Sophie: Yick, Are you okay?

Yick: *Sighs* No. My own brother punched me.

Sophie: Oh… Listen Yick, Tick is kinda… He's been real violent for many years. You probably don't know much about him besides back when you were kids but Tick was abused by his family. I know you were abused by his family but you probably don't know how much he actually suffered. You see, Before Tick came to my lab, He was back in his hometown with you. Tick was abused by his mom and dad as you know. But you probably don't know what happened after Tick left… so it was November 3rd, 2000. Tick has ran away from home while you were asleep. He was on the streets for many years. He'd try to make friends but everyone who saw him would throw cans or something at him and shame him. Tick was always bullied by pretty much everyone in his town. The kids were horrible to him. There was even a time where a person came to Tick and tried to    him.. people hated him. To make things worse, Tick was pressured. He tried to be a good person, He tried to be kind but everything he did always ended up with pain. He was starved, He was cursed with magic one time… He would never be the same. When Tick found you, He was in a adoption center and fortunately he got adopted by his paw and maw in Japan. How did they find him? They were in The US at the time working on the army. You were lucky you got adopted too! Anyways, So you and Tick lived with your adopted parents. But one day Tick ran out the house. He didn't get cake. He told me he was upset because it reminded him of his painful childhood. I don't know how you came here but I know Tick did some great things in his childhood. In Tick's childhood, While he was gone from home, He told me he wasn't home till very late because Tick was working in the Fields to pay off the house for his parents and to make sure his parents retired happy. He told me before he left his abusive parents house, He left 1 million dollars worth of work to his abusive parents. He said they tried to contact him but he never answered. Tick also was coming home late because not only did he work jobs that aren't best for kids, But Tick had been feeding the homeless and he volunteered in many soup kitchens and volunteered to help people in their gardens to earn some additional money. He said he never wanted you to know about this because he didn't want to be a burden to you.

Yick: Oh my gosh, So that's what he's been doing while he was gone? I thought he was just avoiding me and his parents. I thought he was out partying or something.

Sophie: No, He was trying to make both your parents happy. I believe Tick is still violent because he can't help it. He's pretty much just unable to be happy.

Yick: I never wanted to tell Tick the full story so I'm going to tell you a secret… You see, Nobody really knows my full origin. So as you probably know, I'm 26. I was born in the same family as Tick. But fortunately for me, The parents never paid attention to me. I've always been treated like a dog. I was never really abused as long as I followed the rules of the parents and made sure I slept outside. Our parents were very very bad parents. I don't know why but what I know is me and Tick's life wasn't exactly the easiest. I would always hear Tick getting whipped. He was the useless one. I was treated slightly better as long as I acted like a dog. I don't know why our parents are like this but hey, I'm not mom or dad so idk.. anyways, After Tick had left the house my parents started to notice me and since I was their "useful one". They started to notice they could use me for profit. They started experimenting on me. They made me old, they abused me and they really never cared about me. They say they do but I know they never did. So after getting injected by many experiments, That's when I escaped. Once I left, The parents sent out some assassins to    us. That's when we came to Oakland. I don't remember a lot as apparently they erased some of my memories… I've always loved Tick and always stayed strong for him. I've always tried to protect him but I never could. I just want Tick to know that if I could change the past and get rid of it all, I would.

Sophie: Man… You and Tick seemed to be very close. But Yick, I just have a question.

Yick: Mhm?

Sophie: Why don't you live in the lab? You're always welcome here!

Yick: I don't want to be a burden…

Sophie: You won't be a burden! Just come on in!

Yick: Ok…

*Yick enters the lab and Sophie gives him a spare room.*

Yick: Thank you for helping me.

Sophie: No prob!

*Meanwhile at Spruceville.*

KA: *Writing in journal* Gracie will love me…

*Temp enters KA's house and sees him next to a cardboard cutout of Gracie*

Temp: *Puts hand on his shoulder with visible concern* Buddy. Pal. Friend. What in God's name are you doing?

KA: Uhhhh. Nothing? BLAME KURTIS!

Temp: Kurtis isn't here.

KA: Uhhh. My dog ate my homework? I didn't know there was going to be a pop quiz! I never stu d!

Temp: Why is there a cardboard cutout of Gracie next to you?

KA: Oh! That! Uhh well you see, I uhhhhh-

Temp: Ah, Ah, I'm gonna stop you there bucko. I know exactly what you are doing. You… have a cardboard fetish.

KA: No. I'm just uh… I'm uh. I'M NOT HAVING A LOVE FOR CARDBOARD!!!!!

Temp: I'm quite aware of that. I love messing with you. You have a crush on your own creation. She's a teenager, you know? That's illegal in… most countries.

KA: HA! I'm 17 and she's 17!

Temp: You're 17? *looks at cliffsnotes* Oh. Very well then. Might I ask why you love her? You made her.

KA: I don't… I don't know… I just feel weird around her and I think I fell in love with her personality and I might've fell in love with her when I drew her. But alas, Gracie will never love me!

Temp: Oh, woe is me. Can't you just make another character to do your lovie dovie shenanigans with?

KA: NO. But I can make it so Oliver is the owner of Gracie's house and then I can kidnap Gracie and she WILL LOVE ME! YAYAYAYAYAY!

Temp: that is quite possibly the worst idea I have heard since the beginning of time. You aren't very wise, are you?

KA: No. I guess I should try to make myself look attractive and try to get her to like me. The old fashioned way…

Temp: *scoffs* good luck with that. I'm going drinking, toodles. *disappears*

*KA goes to an Oakland clothing store and store for men.*

KA: EXCUSE ME! I'D LIKE A PACKAGE OF SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP ME ATTRACT A BEAUTIFUL GIRL I'M IN LOVE WITH.

Chuck: WELL AS THEY SAYS IN FRONCE, OOOH LAWS LAWS! YOUS IN LOVE? THAT'S COOL!

KA: Yup. I'm trying to attract someone named Gracie. She's the one for me.

Chuck: Well alrights! I gots a package that'll attract ANYONE to yous. But be carefuls as this can attracts someones who may nots bes a hooman. once you finds your lovers, they will never leave you.

KA: Okay, Heard you loud and clear buddy, Now I gotta go get my love!

*KA pays for the package and takes it home. As soon as he's home, He opens the box and puts on the stuff.*

KA: Ok so it says here that once you found your love, I give them this magic rose and they fall in love? Ok simple enough. I'M COMING, GRANDMA- I MEAN I'M COMING, GRACIE!

*KA approaches Gracie's house but suddenly a random Oakland kid that happens to be the same age as KA and is a girl pounces on KA.*

The rose falls on the girl and as soon as she smells the flower, She immediately falls in love with him. It's irreversible.

KA: OH NO! I PICKED THE WRONG PERSON! IT'S SOMEONE WHO ISN'T GRACIE BUT HAPPENS TO BE THE SAME AGE AS ME AND HAPPENS TO BE JUST LIKE GRACIE- Wait a second… Oh wait. That's not so bad. But I've never seen this girl here before.

Mysterious girl: I'M GRACIE'S SISTER, LUCK!!!! THAT'S WHY! I FINALLY FOUND HER AFTER ALL THESE YEARS! EEEEE! But the parents aren't so nice… BUT I'M AS NICE IF NOT NICER THAN GRACIE! Just don't be a weakling and you'll be fine! NOW. CARRY ME!

KA: No! Do it yourself!

*Luck starts to punch and beat up KA*

KA: Y-Yes m-m'aam!

*KA carries Luck all the way to his house and as they enter, Luck locks the door.*

Luck: Okay KA, What do you want to do today? Oh, I know! How about I force you to be my bf! You'll be pampering me and if you don't, I'll beat you up! Okie, Sweetie?

KA: HOW ARE YOU RELATED TO GRACIE?

Luck: Because I'M THE EVIL ONE AND GRACIE'S THE "Goo  two shoes".

KA: Oh… Well uh.. What if I do take care of you and listen to you?

Luck: THEN I'LL STILL BEAT YOU UP! AHAHAHA!

KA: Nope nope nope! I'm outta here.

*Luck grabs KA by the neck and pulls him towards her.*

Luck: oh no, As my slave- I mean boyfriend, YOU'LL DO WHAT I SAY, WHEN I SAY. AND YOU WON'T TALK TO ANYONE!

KA: W-

Luck: UM. DID I SAY YOU COULD TALK, SLAVE?

KA: N-No…

Luck: GOOD. NOW COME ON!

*Meanwhile, With Gracie*

Gracie: Herman, Why are you drinking so much?

Herman: Whaaaat do you mean?

Gracie: *Takes the beer away from Herman* No no no! You're not gonna be a sad Herman no more! Try some of my delicious smoothies! They are really good and healthy!

Herman: BLEH. NUH uh. You can't make me! 😠😝

Gracie: *Gets a smoothie and puts it near Her man's nose so he can smell it* It's chocolate!!!!

Herman: CHOCOLATE? CHOCOLATE? CHOOOOOOCOLATE!

Gracie: Mhm! Now, Say Ahh!

*Herman opens his   mothe and Gracie gives him the smoothie*

Gracie: How you liking that Smoothie, Hun?

Herman: SO DELICIOUS! I GOTTA HAVE MORE!!!!

*Gracie makes a dozen more*

*Herman eats it all but somehow he isn't fat since Gracie makes them healthy.*

Gracie: How's my Herman feeling? Less sad now?

Herman: Yes ma'am!

Gracie: Now, Let's make Sophie proud and make you a scientist!

Herman: Yeah! More smoothies though. I like them.

Gracie: I'm glad you like them, But you can have more later, Sweetie.

*Gracie Hears screaming from outside her house*

Gracie: Wait…Do you hear that?

Herman: no.

Gracie: Stay here, Herman! *Exits the house and follows the sound of the screaming to KA's house*

*Gracie enters and sees Luck. She gasps and looks at Luck with rage.*

Gracie: OH NO YOU DON'T! *Charges at Luck and does epic karate moves on Luck. Luck releases KA and starts to run but Gracie ain't done yet. She starts to fight and wrestle Luck and it appears Luck is weaker than Gracie. (Of course she is)* now you're gonna do two things. One, You're gonna apologize and two, YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT THIS TOWN AND I'LL HAVE MY EYES ON YOU. THERE'S ONLY TWO THINGS THAT DRIVES ME CRAZY. WHEN SOMEONE MESSES WITH MY FRIENDS AND WHEN SOMEONE MESSES WITH CHILDREN! Now Luck, LEAVE OR ELSE I WILL Make you paralyzed…
*Luck runs out Oakland crying like a baby*

Gracie goes to KA and helps him up.

*KA faints. It seems that "love thing" broke because KA found Gracie who somehow broke the curse with her perfectness.*

Gracie: KA, Are you okay?

KA: *Stuttering nervously and staring into Gracie's eyes.*

Gracie: KA? Are you okay? You look a bit spaced out there!

KA: *In some sort of weird love thing where he's staring at Gracie and romantic hearts around her or something.*

Gracie: *Laughs* Are you in love with me, KA?

KA: U-U-U-

Gracie: AWWWWWWWWW! Let's get you back to my house and I'll give you my smoothies to make you feel better? Sounds good, KA?

KA: UH HUH! *In a love trance*

Gracie: EEEE! PERFECT!

Gracie: There you go my lil friend, You got your little chair, bib and you got some cookies and your lil blankie! And now for the smoothie woothie! Does KA want a smoothie?

KA: *Passes out from love*

Gracie feeds him the smoothie and he wakes up and faints again*

Gracie: Aww! He really loves me! I'll give him a chance. But first, Let's see how Herman is doing at his new Science job!

*Gracie calls Herman*

Herman: Hey Gracie! I'm at Snowie's place, I'm a scientist again! Well, Gotta go now, BYEEEEE!

Gracie: Wait! Uh. Herman. I don't really have any room for you and KA so you'll have to go back and apologize to Soph. I can help you later on!

Herman: Sounds good! Bye now!

Gracie: Bye! *Ends call and goes to Herman who is now fast asleep*

Gracie: Aww! *Takes KA to my bedroom and tucks him in and falls asleep as well.*

*Zee next day.*

Gracie: *Wakes up and taps on KA. He seems to turn to the other side and cover his head with a pillow* Wake up, KA! Or should I say, My new boyfriend?

KA: *Wakes up but is still very sleepy* WHA- *sees Gracie and passes out and falls back asleep*

Gracie: Ok KA, I'll let you sleep! I'm going to watch you sleep too since this will be my obsession now. Since I made a deal with Sophie, I can only obsess over my boyfriend and not random boys.

*Gracie watches KA, Fascinated by him*

*After KA wakes up*

Gracie: Good morning, KA! Would you like some breakfast? You look like you need some breakfast!

KA: AHHHHHH GRACIE YOU'RE TALKING TO ME AND I- *Excited and happy but wanting to faint again*

Gracie: Please don't faint! You don't have to be afraid of me! Look at me, KA! Look at my eyes and feel the soothing person I am!

*KA looks into Gracie's eyes and immediately feels calm and not fainty*

Gracie: Alright KA! Ready for me to pamper you? I should be the one taking care of you! I saw how Luck was trying to hurt you so I need to take extra care of my lil cutie bf, KA!

KA: MORE SMOOTHIES PWEASE!

Gracie: Okay, But I want to change your name. KA just doesn't sound right. From now on, Your gonna be Aarie! (OH GOD)

Aarie: I need more cookies and more smoothies and more Gracie!!!!!

Gracie: Aww! Okay Aarie, Go sit in your chair! I'll be right back with a magic potion to permanently make you a kid.

*Gracie gets the potion and comes back. She puts it in her healthy smoothie and gives it to Aarie*

Gracie: Drink up, my   friend!

*He drinks the drink and is now  the same age as YA (13).*

Gracie: Alright Aarie! Let's give you some cookies and you can go relax on the bed and watch some cartoons! I'll be there to pamper and love you! Just don't become spoiled, Aarie! Haha, I know you won't because as soon as you are around me, That compassion is always in you and around you and that healing is always around you too. Now go enjoy your cartoons, My   friend!

Meanwhile… Wyatt is back at the lab. He knocks on the door, despite already having his own room. He doesn't think he belongs there. Sophie answers.

Sophie: Oh hey Wyatt! Why'd you knock? You know you are welcome here.

Wyatt shakes his head. He takes her hand and takes her to his room. She sees he made a really big blueprint of a huge mansion. It says "UNDERWATER HOME" he points at it.

Sophie: You wanna build a house underwater? I'm not sure I can help with building, how about you ask Cleetus and Kurtis?

Wyatt tilts his head.

Sophie: Oh, you've never met them before? Let me take you there.

She takes him to the megabarn. She takes him to the top of the barn to the manager's office. Cleetus isn't here right now, so it's only Kurtis.

Sophie: Hey Kurtis!

Kutis: Well hoooooooooowdy fellers! *he sees Wyatt* who's the littleums feller?

Sophie: This is Wyatt. He's still a little new to this town. He's really shy and doesn't really speak. I'll speak for him.

*Temp walks in and gasps*



Temp: Yeah, Sure you do, Bucko.

Gracie: What's the matter, Temp? Just helping out Aarie here! Hehe, I renamed him since the KA name was not really "fitting" for him.

Temp: Gracie, Could you give me and "Aarie" a second to discuss?

Gracie: Mhm! *Goes to make more smoothies in the kitchen*

KA: I'm still the same old KA! I'm just uh… Kinda forced to live a life where Gracie is my GRANDMA- I mean caretaker.

Temp: you really became what you swore to destroy. You know, I would normally help you since I uh.. I can literally do anything. But, I'm not very happy with this. You're on your own buddy. *opens a portal to his realm where only he can access* I'm outta here.

KA: WAIT NOOO- I gotta fix this. I gotta break up with Gracie… Oh but I love her- *slaps myself* NO. I HAVE TO BE STRONG AND BREAK UP!

Gracie: There you go! Well, Goodbye for now, KA! I'm going to go spy on some boys now, BYEEEEE!

*KA goes back to his house and does his usual writing of stories.*

Gracie: Hmm. Since there are so many people in Oakland, I need to find someone who won't have any conflicts…

*Gracie remembers Cleetus*

Gracie: Well… I guess I have to ask Cleetus about this….

*Gracie goes to the diner*

Gracie: Cleetus? You in here?

*Cleetus turns around*

Cleetus: Well hooooooooooowdy- *Eyes pop out* G-G-G-G-G-GRAACIE? WHAT'S YOUS DOSIN HERES?

Gracie: I need some advice on something. Since I first met you I guess you're my first friend here so I'm going to come to you when I need advice.

Cleetus: WOO WEEEE! OKAYS!

Gracie: You seem awfully excited today!

Cleetus: I THINKS IT'S TIMES I TELLS YOU! GRACIES, I LOVES YOU!

Gracie: Oh Cleetus, I can't date you! You're way older than me!

Cleetus: Waits. Aren't yous an adultsum?

Gracie: No. I'm still a kid.

Cleetus: OHS. THIS IS UH… EMBARRASES! I THOUGHTS YOU WERES AS OLDS AS ME?

Gracie: No! I'm still a kid!

Cleetus: Well um. I'm very embarrasses.

Gracie: Oh it's okay! You didn't know! But we can still be friends!

Cleetus: Okays!

Gracie: So anyways, my advice is uhh do you happen to know anyone who needs a girlfriend who is the same age as me?

Cleetus: Ask Mikesum. I have nose ideas.

Gracie: Ok.

*Gracie goes to the SCAWY mansion*

Gracie: *Knocks*

Door creaks open.

Mike: Hyello?

Gracie: Hey Mike, uh… Can I come in and talk?

Mike: hm. *Looks at imaginary watch* Ok. Make it quick. *lets her in*

Gracie: So Cleetus told me to ask you about if you know any people who can date me that are kids.

Mike: What you mean? there aren't kids in basement or anything if you accuse me of so.

Gracie: I was just a g if you know where some 15 year olds are. I'm trying to find someone the same age as me to date…

Mike: ugh, fine. I'm tired of kids living in basement. *Goes into basement which looks like a mansion* GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! *all the kids run out all about 15-16 years old and a bunch of other children. They go to the lab.* ah, finally. Go date.

Gracie: Ok bye.

*Gracie goes to the lab*

Gracie: hmm. How am I going to do this?

*A kid goes up to Gracie and sprays strawberry milk at her*

Gracie: Ack! Why did you do that?

*The child runs away laughing but then they come back and jump on Gracie.*

Child: Hewwo!

Gracie: Why did you spray me with strawberry milk???

Child: I wikey two spway spway. I sowwy! *Hugging Gracie*

Gracie: Uh, ok. Are all of you like this?

Alex: No, not all of us…

She looks at Alex. He looks depressed.

Gracie: Hi there, I'm Gracie! What’s your name?

Alex: Alex.

Gracie: I see. Want to go to my place? and I'll take care of you!

Alex: Okay!

*Gracie and Alex go do their own things in the house*

*Meanwhile with Aaron in the real world*

*Aaron gets a text on his phone*

Aaron: Hmm? Did Conner text me or something?

*Aaron notices another Oakland light*

Aaron: *Calls Conner* Hey, I found another light in that forest. You want to see if it's an Oakland light?

Conner: I kinda do want to see more about the LORE so sure, But uh… I'm going to have to come back to TX…

Aaron: Do you see a Oakland light? Are you near a forest?

Conner: I do see some sort of light but I'm not at a forest.

Aaron: Let's hope this takes us to Oakland. On 3, We jump. 1..

Conner: 2..

Aaron: 3!!

They both jump in at the same time. They plummet through things and eventually land back where they started in Oakland originally.

Aaron: Oh, that was easy.

Conner: Let’s get there fast!

Meanwhile in the lab…

Wyatt does a wandering around when he runs into Oliver. He falls over to the ground pretty easily (He is very lightweight and you could probably guess why)

Oliver: *Helps Wyatt up* Hello there! I've never seen you here before! Are you new?

Wyatt shrugs his shoulders. He has no idea how long he has been here for.

Oliver: Can you speak?

He looks away and shakes his head.

Oliver: Oh, Ok. What's your name? *I reach in my pocket and grab a note  friendk and pen and hand it to Wyatt* Here you go, Now you can write what you want to say. Unless you already have a note  friendk? Anyways, I'll introduce myself. Firstly, I'm Oliver and I don't really know how long I've been here but I am kinda new here. I'm assuming you don't know how long you've been here? But anyway, I actually live in the lab. I have a friend named Sophie that I'd like you to meet.

Wyatt opens his   mothe like he is about to say something, but looks back down and writes on the note  friendk, “I know her. She is nice.”

Oliver: Oh! Ok! Well, What's your name?

Wyatt: (Note  friendk obviously) Wyatt.

Oliver: Nice to meet you, Wyatt. So, Where do you live?

He thinks about it for a little bit before writing.

Wyatt: Somewhere in Oregon… Don't know where. Big endless forest area around it.

Oliver: I see. Where do you live in Oakland? That's what I meant.

Wyatt: (writing) I live in a lake with Mariana. She's my mom now. She adopted me. She is better than other parents.

Oliver: Oh. I see. Well uh. It was good meeting you. Maybe we'll cross again

Wyatt nods and walks off. Oliver finally realizes his   is red, like literally red.

Oliver: Hm. Interesting.

Later, Oliver pays Wyatt a little visit.

Oliver goes to the lake and looks at it, confused with how he is supposed to get down there.

Mariana comes out from the lake. She is holding a waterproof bag that has cheese in it and she is eating it.

Mariana: Ahh, sweet cheese. Something good that humans have made for once. *Sees Oliver* Um… can I help you?

Oliver: Um. I want to visit Wyatt. I just met him and want to learn more about him.. Is that okay?

Mariana: Oh. *lightens up a little* He's making friends? Oh I'm so excited! *small Gracie EEE sound* i'm helping him set up his bedroom, but he'll be out in a minute. Let me take you down.

She gives him a bubble helmet like the sandy helmets but not glass. She takes him down to a very nice looking house and enters. It's very aquatic themed and looks like it is built for giant sea creatures like her.

Mariana: Wait on the couch. He'll be out in a minute.

A few minutes later, Wyatt comes swimming/walking? out. He sees Oliver and sits on the couch.

Oliver: Hey Wyatt!

He waves shyly.

Mariana: Oh, and I'm able to read his thoughts, so I can basically be his translator for you. Also I have snacks in case you need some. *She puts down some Kelp Jerky, Kelp Nougat Crunch, drinkable sausage, and Fizzy Fang (found in spongebob wiki).*

Wyatt grabs a Fizzy Fang, with only the drinkable sausage left for Oliver. Wyatt grabs the nougat crunch and Oliver grabs the jerky.

Mariana: So uh, I guess you can talk now.

Mariana leaves the room. Wyatt and Oliver stare at each other awkwardly.

Oliver: Hey Wyatt!

Wyatt waves shyly.

Oliver: I never really got to know you at the lab. Are you ok with telling me about yourself?

Wyatt looks down. He hesitates, but nods. He begins writing a lot on his water proof note  friendk.. It takes him a while but he finishes and gives it to Oliver. It is basically everything about how his family is abusive in every way and everything he had to put up with. Oliver almost cries from how sad it is.

Oliver: w-wow *sniffles* I can't believe you had to deal with that all your life. I'm so mad at your original parents, why would they abandon you as soon as you are born?! They can't just judge you like that! But- I understand why you don't want to talk now. If you ever need someone to talk to or a shoulder to cry on, you can count on me.

Wyatt nods slowly.

Oliver: Well, how is your   red anyway?

Wyatt shrugs his shoulders.

Oliver: guess we'll never know.

Wyatt: (writing) what about you? Who are you like?

Oliver: I was born in Utah. I had a nice mom and dad but I had a mean sister who would beat me up and I hated it. But then I moved to a town which taught me how to be compassionate and love nature and drawing and magic. Then I settled here.

Wyatt nods.

MEANWHILE- Conner and Aaron finally arrive at Oakland once again.

They split up (GANG). Aaron goes to the lab and Conner goes to the Wellington Theater

Meanwhile with Aaron

*Aaron enters the lab. Gracie is watching him and saying EEEEE as she sees him.*

Sophie: Hey Aaron! What are you doing back at Oakland?

Aaron: Oh nothing! Just a little bit of exploring!

Sophie: Ok! So who do you want to see?

Aaron: Well GRACIE'S been stalking me so I'm assuming she wants me to visit her as she seems very excited and won't stop saying EEEE and standing behind me and breathing on my neck. So I guess I gotta visit her again.

Sophie: Ok Aaron.

*Aaron follows Gracie to her house*

Gracie: EEEEEEEE!!!!! I KNEW YOU'D BE BACK! How about a smoothie? How about I come back to your place with you???

Aaron: No.

*Gracie clings onto Aaron. She hugs him and doesn't let go*

Aaron: GET OFF ME.

Gracie: NO.

Aaron: Fine. I'll get Conner to get you off.

*Aaron goes to find Conner while ignoring Gracie still holding onto him and not letting go.*

*Aaron sees Conner and follows him*




Meanwhile with Conner… He enters the theater. He sees Ash training a new guy for the theater.

Ash: Alright kid, we're gonna start simple. I'm gonna get this here jar, an I'm gonna open it. Now ya may be wonderin why jar openin mattas, well it doesn't! I'm just tryna see if ya have some sorta strength, cause holdin those cameras needs some muscle. We're gonna open a jar. *pops jar open* easy! Now you try, first get a jar.

The newbie (named Patrick unironically) holds a pickle.

Ash: Patrick, that's a pickle.

Patrick: Yes.

Ash: Ya need a jar. Here, use mine. *Gives him the jar*

Conner: Uh, hi there.

Ash looks over and sees Conner. He appears behind him while Patrick continues opening a jar.

Ash: Why hello there, young man! What brings ya here on this fine day?

Conner: Hey Ash. I am here because I have a little something to show you.

Ash: Ah, it seems ya already know me. Very well! Show me this thing ya want t’ show me.

Conner: You see, I created you. I am basically your god. Without me, you would never have existed.

Ash: What are ya sayin?

Conner: You used to be a psychopath, but I decided to change that by making Temp go back in time and save your mother. If you want, I could recover your past memories.

Ash: What in god’s name is a Temp? What sorta nonsense is this?

Conner snaps his fingers and Ash suddenly regains all his psychotic memories. His staff wand thingy glows brightly and has a very powerful aura. (His wand’s power is based on his insanity.)

Ash: Wh- what is alla this??? What’s going on?!

Conner: You are remembering your true origin. I just thought it would be nice if you knew. K BYE!! *Leaves* (Conner causing trouble as always)

*Conner sees Aaron and goes to him*

Aaron: Gracie again…

Conner: She's not coming home with us.

Aaron: THAT'S WHAT I KEEP TRYING TO TELL HER BUT SHE'S LIKE NOT COMING OFF ME!

Conner: She's coming off. Whether I have to do it the easy way or the hard way…

Aaron: GET HER OFF ME!

Conner: Listen up Gracie, You either come off willingly or Red will force you off.

Gracie: NO.  I'M COMING WITH HIM!

*Red appears and throws Gracie off Aaron*

Aaron: Thanks Red!

Red: No problem, creators. You are welcome here for free pizza anytime.

*Aaron and Conner jump in the portal, but Gracie got back on Aaron just as they went in the portal so now Gracie is out of Oakland with them.

Gracie: EEEEEE!!!

Aaron: Uh oh… uh Conner? We kinda have a issue!

Conner: What?

Aaron: Gracie is kinda in the real world! Uh…

Conner: HOW!?!

Aaron: She must've jumped on me again and I didn't notice.

Gracie: AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE MINE!!!! *Hugging Aaron and not letting go*

Aaron: GET OFF ME, GRACIE!!!

Gracie: NO!

Aaron: *I grab my note  friendk* DON'T MAKE ME USE THIS-

*Gracie grabs it*

Gracie: YAY! NOW I CAN BE WITH YOU FOREVER! AND YOU CAN DRINK MY SMOOTHIES! * Tries to grab some smoothies from my pocket but realizes my magic doesn't work here* Wait… WHAT? WHY CAN'T I TAKE OUT SMOOTHIES?

Aaron: Oh yeah! I forgot I made it so when Oakland characters leave and accidentally come here, They can't use their magic on us. So yay. Ha! Gracie you are powerless!

Gracie erases "Characters can't do magic outside of Oakland"

Gracie: SMOOTHIE TIME. *Grabs a smoothie from my pocket and feeds it to Aaron*

Aaron: HEY- MMMMPH!

*Gracie force feeds Aaron the smoothie*

*Aaron swallows it*

Aaron: Wait a second… IS THAT PEANUT BUTTA ANDS CHOCOLUT NANNER SMOOTHIE? HOW'D YOU KNOW?

Gracie: I knew you'd like it! What, You think I was going to give you a smoothie that turns you into a baby?

Aaron: Uh. Yeah!

*Gracie feeds Conner the same smoothie but different cup.*

Conner: … PEANUT BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE WITH NANNERS? MMMMMMMM!!!!!

Gracie: I knew you'd guys like it! NOW… back to my obsession over Aaron! Hehehehe!!

Aaron: WHY ME? HMM?

Gracie: Well you created me and you look so CUUUUUTE!

Aaron: OH SO I'M CUTE? WELL I'LL MAKE MYSELF LOOK UGLY!

*Aaron goes to get plastic surgery and comes back. He looks as bad as Michael Jackson after plastic surgery.*

Gracie: I still love you! From your heart!

Aaron: GRRRRRRRR!!!!! *Writes in my note  friendk "Aaron reversed Plastic surgery and back to normal" and he's back to normal without plastic surgery.* I'LL RIP OUT MY HEART!

Gracie: NO! WHY?

Aaron: I DON'T LIKE YOU…

Gracie: Why? 🥺

Aaron: DON'T YOU GIVE ME THOSE PUPPY EYES! I'M NOT LOOKING AT YOU! *Turns away*

Gracie goes in front of Aaron and stares directly with puppy eyes*

Aaron: I… I CAN'T RESIST… TOO- TOO- TOO- TOO CUUUUUTE!

*Gracie's puppy eyes seem to be hypnotizing Aaron. Conner kicks Gracie in the stomach and Gracie screams. Aaron is now unhypnotized.*

Gracie: OW MY STOMACH!

Aaron: Wait a second. How does Oakland logic still work here?

Gracie: Well I'm here! Duh! If you read rule 365 in your note  friendk which I may or may not have a copy of, It says "Anyone sent to IRL and not Oakland has the Oakland logic follow them."

Aaron: WAIT A SECOND, HOW DID YOU GET A HOLD OF MY NOTE  friendK-

Conner: Uh. Guys, Can we just stop arguing and think of something reasonable here?

Gracie: SHUT UP, CO CREATOR!

Aaron: HEY! DON'T CALL HIM CO CREATOR! *Punches Gracie in the stomach but Gracie blocks it and twists my arm around* OOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWW!!!

Gracie: NOW. Instead of screaming and crying, Why don't I just live here? What's the problem with me? Hmm?

Conner: Well for one, You are annoying, Two, You are obsessive and another thing -

*Gracie goes over to Conner and kicks him in the balls*

Gracie: SHUT UP! (Conner: me nards-)

*Gracie gently picks up Aaron and hugs him*

Aaron: Why are you acting so violent to us?

Gracie: I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO LOVE MEEEEEE!!!!

Aaron: UGH.. I THOUGHT I GAVE YOU SOMEONE TO LOVE ALREADY!!!!

Gracie: THEY WERE TAKEN! (Conner in background: That's it, I'm gettin me mallet)

Aaron: *Sighs and speaks in a calm tone* Ok fighting and arguing isn't going to get us anywhere. Look Gracie, If we help you, Will you please leave us alone?

*Conner knocks out Gracie with a mallet*

Aaron: Phew! Thanks for saving me from Gracie's obsessive behavior.

Conner: You're welcome, Now we need to figure out how to send Gracie back. We need to find another Oakland light. Do you have any other forests nearby? And also, How did I get in Texas if I had came from Tennessee to Oakland and then Oakland to Texas?

Aaron: Oh yeah, Well uh. If you enter Oakland from any location and then if you leave Oakland from any exit in Oakland, You end up back in Texas.

Conner: Oh. You can't just go back to your original location?

Aaron: Nope. Only Texas. Anyways, Let's focus on the task at hand. We need to get Gracie back to Oakland.

Conner: But how?

Aaron: Well since magic isn't real in real life, We'll have to wait for an Oakland light to appear. Once it does, Throw Gracie at it and she'll be back in Oakland.

Conner: Should we stand back in case we are accidentally thrown back in it?

Aaron: We have to make sure the light doesn't see us. If it does, We will be back in there. So we need to run once we throw her back in the light. Wait. Actually, Since Sophie controls those lights, Unless Sophie tells the light to suck us in or if someone else is controlling it and is an idiot, We should be fine.

Conner: Ok well where is an Oakland light? I don't see one in this forest we're at.

Aaron: We have to be lost for one to appear. And here's a fun fact about Oakland, You can only enter Oakland if you are a kid 1-17. Anyways, So uh. We need to be lost in a forest. (Hm how did Ash get in then)

Conner: Ok then, Let's get lost?

Aaron: I never thought we'd have to say that. BUT YEAH! LET'S GET LOST!

*Gracie wakes up and sees she is being dragged. She bites Aaron's hand and tackles him down*

Gracie: YOU ARE NOT TAKING ME BACK THERE! YOU WILL BE MINE!!!!

*Aaron reaches in Gracie's pocket to grab a smoothie and he gives it to Gracie*

Gracie: OOOOO! A SMOOTHIE! *Drinks it and falls in a deep sleep*

Aaron: *carries Gracie*

Conner: So how far do we have to go?

Aaron: Until we don't recognize where we are. So very far.

Conner: Aww man! But I don't want to walk for a long time!

Aaron: Me neither. I just want to be home playing Homescapes or playing fork and sausage on my 1p Nokia phone.

Conner: And I just want to do whatever I do when I'm on the call!

*They both see a Oakland light*

Aaron: Well we appear to be "lost"!

Conner: Yay- I mean oh no! We're lost! Wherever will we go? Oh! A light? Let's throw Gracie in there!

*Aaron throws Gracie in the Oakland light and Gracie disappears and appears into Oakland. The Oakland light starts coming towards us.*

Aaron: I think it wants us to follow it home.

*We follow the light and are led out the forest*

Conner: Yay!

Aaron: By the way, What did you do while you were in Oakland?

Conner: Oh, that… uh, I might have recovered Ash's psychotic memories. But hey, that'll be an interesting story. *realization* Wait. HOW DO I GET HOME??

Aaron: Hm, I still have the   friendk. I can write you home.

Conner: Oh, right.

Aarons writes “Conner returns home and his parents don’t even know that he was gone.”

A few minutes later at his house, he gets a meet call.

Conner: Hyello. I am playing bacon game.

Aaron: I'm playing fork and sausage. I'm Kurtis and ims a sausage!

*Luke suddenly calls Aaron*

Aaron: Huh? I'm getting a call from Luke.

Conner: Oh ok.

Luke: HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY BUDDY! HOW'S IT GOING, PARTNER? GUESS WHAT? I'M COMING TO A CONCERT TONIGHT! IT'S ABOUT BRITTANY SPEARS! I'LL ALSO BE TALKING ABOUT SOME GOOD OL EDM!

Aaron: Uh. Ok. Well uh how about you come over to my house tonight?

Luke: NAH NAH NAH NOW, I'm going to a concert and I just can't miss the good ol' Brittney Spears! She's going to be divin’ under that good ol' water now! Can't wait to see her! I'm gonna go and get myself a Ford pickup truck! Now here's some EDM for you to listen to while I'm gone. I'm going to ask you a ton of questions when I get back now so study reeeeaaaal hard!

Aaron: What if I don't study?

Luke: Then I'll force you to!

Aaron: Fine. I'll study.

Luke: Good job, Buddy! Gotta go now!

*Luke ends the call*

Aaron: Why does he act like this? I'm going to get to the bottom of this…

*Aaron goes up to his mom*

Aaron: Hey mom, Can I pwease go to Luke's house to investigate about how he is?

Tara: Why don't you and Luke get along? Luke's a sweet kid, Why are you assuming he's crazy?

Aaron: BECAUSE HE ISSSSSSS! WHY WON'T YOU BELIEVE MEEEEEEE? PWEASE CAN I GO TO HIS HOUSE? PWEEEEEEEASE?

Tara: Fine. I guess since you are almost 17, You can go there on your own.

Aaron: Yay! Thanks mom!

Tara: Take your bike there! I don't want you crashing my car!

Aaron: Ok!

*Aaron goes in his garage, He grabs his cool shades and puts on his biker gear. He grabs his bike and turns on the electric motor and opens his garage and closes it as gets out of the house.*

Aaron: Oh yeah! Let's do dis. Time to go solve a mystery! But wait, Imma call Conner! He'll probably want to help me solve a mystery!

*Aaron calls Conner on his 1p Nokia phone*

Aaron: Hello!

*Conner sees Aaron with the shades and bike gear on*

Conner: What's going on now?

Aaron: I'm going to Luke's house to solve a mystery! Want to help?

Conner: Can I be Cleetus? *Throws on a cowboy hat* YEEEEEEHAW! I'M CLEETUS!

Aaron: And I'm a cool cat! Now uh. Time to put my bike into maximum overdrive! *Aaron speeds on over to Luke's house* Now, Once we get there, We act cool! It's time to see what really is going on in Luke's house…

*Aaron arrives and knocks on the door*

*Luke's mom answers*

Luke's mom: Aaron? What are you doing here?

Aaron: Well I was just in the neighborhood with my goofy partner deputy, Cleetus and we wanted to see what is going on in Luke's house. So I was thinking to spend a day to see what happens here. If that's okay?

Luke's mom: Is your mom okay with this?

Aaron: Yep!

Luke's mom: Alright, Come on in.

Aaron: We're in! Yes!

*Aaron enters. Conner is still on the meet call wearing his cowboy hat*

Conner: You weren't lying when you were saying how Luke lives in a rich house… this place looks like a mansion!

Aaron: Yup.

Luke's mom: Luke, Hanna and the others, Come on out! I have a visitor who will be staying for a day!

*Luke comes out. He seems angry but he sees Aaron and quickly switches back to a excited looking person. Luke locks his door as something is screaming in his room.*

Luke: WELL HOOOOOWDY BUDDY!

Aaron: Woah woah woah. Easy. I'm just staying here for a day to examine how your family is…

Luke's mom: Everyone here is such an angel! *Looking at Luke* Well, Luke's special in his own way…

Aaron: I see.

Luke's mom: Anyways, I'm going to go work on some work stuff.

*Luke's sister comes to Aaron*

Luke's sister: *Hugs Aaron* Hello!

Aaron: Hey Hanna, Do you want to tell me more about Luke?

Luke's sister (Hanna): I always hear him yelling at mom.

Aaron: I see. Thank you for letting me know about this. We'll be investigating more about Luke.

Hanna: I wouldn't go in there, He may be angry… I GOTTA GO NOW! LUKE IS GOING TO BE MAD IF I TOOK HIS BRITTNEY SPEARS   friendK! *Grabs Brittany Spears   friendk and runs away to my room*

*Luke heard all this. He exits his room.*

Luke: *Pushes Aaron down* GET OUTTA MY WAY! *Runs to Hannah's room and grabs the   friendk. I go back to my room and throw Hanna in there.* NOBODY STEALS MY   friendK!

*Luke begins screaming at Hanna and violently shaking her. (I assume that's what he does as I have seen him get angry at his siblings before when I was in his house)*

Luke slams his door shut and screaming is heard. He then throws Hanna out his room and he begins screaming in his very deep voice that always sounds sarcastic and country.

Aaron: Uh. Do you see how crazy he is?

Conner: Yeah.

Aaron: This is what I mean when I say Luke is CRAZY.

Conner: I see now.

*Luke exits his room and grabs Aaron and drags him in his room*

Luke: Alright buddy, Now did you do that studying I told you about doing? *Eyes are wide and crazy. Staring into Aaron's eyes like a maniac. Waiting for Aaron to respond* Now don't you say no or else I'm going to force you…

Aaron: Yes? I did?

Luke: Oh yeah? You did huh? Well let's see! You better NOT be lying now!

Aaron: Totally not!

Luke: Ok then! Answer my question…. Why are motorcycles able to park?

Conner: Um. Really?

Luke: SHUT UP, YOU! I'm not TALKING to you! I'm talking to Aaron!

Aaron: I don't want to answer!

Luke: WRONG CHOICE…

Conner: Please leave him alone!

Aaron: Please just leave me alone!

Luke: *laughing* OH I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUDDY! I'm just a sweet wittle innocent person and could never hurt a fly!

Aaron: YOU AREN'T REALLY A SWEET PERSON, ARE YOU?

Luke: HAHA. You figured it out, Buddy. I have been faking being nice, I'm not actually disabled, BUT I HAVE ALL MY SIBLINGS UNDER MY CONTROL… And also, I WILL FORCE YOU TO ANSWER MY QUESTION…

Aaron: NO!

Luke: We can do this the easy way or hard way…

*Suddenly Luke's mom enters and Luke acts like he's trying to hug Aaron*

Luke's mom: How's everything over here?

Luke: Fantastic, Mom!

Luke's mom: Great!

*She exits*

Aaron: *I go to the corner of the room*

Conner: What are you going to do?

Aaron: I have to call him. Sebastian. Hopefully he can help. Lemme get him on the meet call.

*Aaron adds Sebastian to the call*

Sebastian: Hey Aaron! What's up?

Aaron: Hey Sebastian. Um. How's your weekend?

Sebastian: Going good! Just listening to some rock.

Conner: Uh. Hi.

Sebastian: Hello, Who are you?

Conner: I'm Conner. Another one of Aaron's friends. I'm assuming you are Sebastian?

Sebastian: Yes. I am Sebastian. So what are you guys doing?

Aaron: Well uh… Nothing much-

*Luke grabs Aaron's phone*

Sebastian: OH MY GOSH. IS THAT LUKE?

Luke: Hello Sebastian!

Aaron: HELP ME!!! HE'S TRYING TO FORCE ME TO ANSWER HIS QUESTION!!!!

*Luke grabs Aaron and drags him over to a sofa. He forces him to study real hard*

Luke: Now you're going to study and you're going to like it!

Conner: So uh. You're probably very confused.

Sebastian: Yeah! What is going on?

Conner: Well we were trying to figure out about Luke but we kinda found out how he's an evil mastermind!

Sebastian: I KNEW IT!!!!

Conner: Huh?

Sebastian: When me and Aaron first met at United through hope, Me, him and Luke were in a group. Luke was always…. Focused on Aaron. Like in a weird way. He would always stare at him and wait for him to answer. And if he didn't… He'd just force him to. I tried to talk but he'd hush me off and when Mrs Thatcher tried to talk to him, He'd yell at her and demand her to leave. He's always been nothing but an narcissistic a**hole. But I've realized ever since I met Aaron… I felt odd. Like he's been a really good friend. I've never really had a friend who'd hang out with me. I was always around bad people or always getting into trouble… I've kinda grown up too fast.

Conner: He's told me about you.

Sebastian: I hear you two talk a lot too.

Conner: We do.

Sebastian: Aaron talks to me a lot as well.

Conner: He's told me about you.

Sebastian: I know. He's told me about you. He says that you are a good friend. What does he say about me?

Conner: He hasn't told me much about you. But he has told me you are misunderstood. He says you curse a lot and say a lot of things.

Sebastian: I do tend to do a lot of things that I don't realize. I don't really know how to control myself. I'm not crazy, I just get angry and have a lot of problems. I've been around a lot of bad influences and I regret it. But I'm trying to change. For the better.

Conner: I see. So we should probably do something about Aaron now.

Sebastian: I agree. I have a plan though. I'm coming to Luke's house. I should be there in 30 minutes. I'm going to take a plane there. Why? Cause I live far away. I'm staying on the meet call. So for now, We need to distract him.

Conner: I can try.

*Conner starts making Patrick quotes*

Conner: The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.

Conner: I wumbo, you wumbo, he she we, wumbo. The study of wumbo? Wumbology? It's first grade, SpongeBob.

*30 minutes later, Sebastian arrives*

Sebastian: HEY LUKE. REMEMBER ME?

*Luke turns around*

Luke: (Luke speaks in his innocent sarcastic country voice) Hey there! Hmm. Do I remember you? No? I don't. Would you like to be friends?

Sebastian: *Walks up to Luke and laughs in his face* NO.

Luke: WRONG ANSWER.

Sebastian: *Twists Luke's arm around* Don't underestimate me, Luke. I'm stronger and taller than you.

*Luke screams as his arm is in pain*

Luke: I WILL NOT LET SOMEONE LIKE YOU STOP ME! I'LL JUST HAVE AARON BEAT YOU UP!

Sebastian: What? He wouldn't!

Luke: AARON. YOU WILL GET YOUR BUTT UP AND PUNCH SEBASTIAN OR ELSE…

Sebastian: No, don't listen to him, Aaron.

Luke: LISTEN TO ME!!!!

Sebastian: DON'T LISTEN TO HIM!

*Aaron starts to feel peer pressured and screams loudly*

Aaron: I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!

Luke: DO IT.

Aaron: NO.

*Luke gets up and grabs a   friendk and is about to hit Aaron with it*

Luke: YES…

*Sebastian kicks Luke to the ground and beats him up*

Luke: HEY! STAWP!!!!!

Sebastian: Get outta here, You brat.

*Luke runs away and fake cries*

*Sebastian helps Aaron up*

Sebastian: There you go. Now you won't be brainwashed by that narcissist.

Aaron: *Trying to process information* Did you save me?

Sebastian: Yeah? So what?

Aaron: I am so glad I found the truth about Luke. Unfortunately, I can't really do anything about him. He's just going to come back and act like everything's normal.

Sebastian: Then what should we do?

Aaron: Hmm. Conner, Got any ideas?

Conner: What if we take him to Oakland?

Aaron: Great idea.

Sebastian: Well I better get home as I gotta be home for dinner so I'll see you two later.

*Sebastian goes back home*

*Aaron picks up Luke and carries him to a Oakland light*

*He throws him in*

*Luke enters Oakland*

*Aaron jumps into Oakland as well*

*Conner finds an Oakland light and enters as well.*

*They got the good landing while Luke crashes down*

*Luke gets up and looks around*

Luke: WHERE IN THE BRITTNEY SPEARS ARE WE ARE?

Aaron: We're in Oakland. Don't you remember? I told you I made a story but you stole it somehow…

Luke: It was easy. I just changed it up a bit.

Aaron: So uh. I'm sure you'll get along with a nice person called Gracie. She's very nice and compassionate.

Luke: Oh reeeeeallly? Take me to her.

Aaron: Very well.

*Aaron takes Luke to Gracie’s house and he throws him in there.*

*We'll get back to Luke later…*

Aaron: So what do you want to do while we're here?

Conner: Uh. I dunno.

Aaron: How about we find more LORE? Let's not split up.

Conner: Ok.

Aaron: I guess I'll follow you to your characters first.

Conner and Aaron go to the lake. Conner knocks on water like a door. Mariana comes out with Wyatt and Oliver sitting on her head.

Mariana: Can't you see I'm busy here?

Conner: Hi there Mariana. Let me get to the point, I created you and I am basically your god.

Mariana cracks up.

Mariana: Oh sure you are. Why don't you turn this lake into a proper ocean if you are.

Conner: Ok. *makes the lake into an entire mini ocean (sea I guess)*

Mariana: ……Oh. I see. What brings you here then?

Conner: just visiting.

Wyatt waves. Conner waves back.

Conner: I guess I'll be on my way then.

Mariana: Ok then, God.

They leave.

Conner: My characters aren't very interesting. You lead the way.

*Aaron goes to the goofy fellers megabarn to see what the goofy fellers are ups to.*

Kurtis: WEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLL HOOOOOOOOOOO-

Cleetus: THAT'S MY LINESUM. *Ahem* WELL HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWDY FELLERS! WELCOME TOS THE GOOFY FELLERS DINUMS! *Sees Conner* Hey, I seens you befores! Yous God!

Conner: Yep. This is Aaron, the other God.

Aaron: Hi. I'm the creator of Kurtis.

Kurtis: NUH UHS!

Aaron: *turns Kurtis into a sausage*

Kurtis: I'M KURTIS AND IMS A SAUSAGE!

Cleetus: Whys he a sausage?

Aaron: FORK N SAUSAGE GAMEPLAY FOR 10 HOURS AND 10K LIKES ON TOO MUCH TOILETS GAMEPLAY.

Conner: Sorry about him. He's uh, mentally challenged. I think.

Aaron slaps him with the Kurtis sausage.

Conner: >:(

Aaron: Naw. I ain't. I'm just crazy like Patrick.

Aaron: The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. It may stupid but it's also dumb. If we filter the co 2 balsik tanks, we can retire the engine and ride the shockwave outta here.

Kurtis: IMS A SAUSAGE!

Conner turns him back into a human and bonks Aaron on the head with a mallet.

Conner: Enough nig nagging!

Kurtis: I'M NOT A TURKUMS!

Conner: *confused confusion* can we visit a more… normal character of yours?

Aaron: Sure. Let's go to Sophie's lab.

*They enter da lab*

Sophie: Hey there creators!

Aaron: Hey Sophie.

Conner: Hi.

Sophie: What brings you two back here?

Aaron: Well I dunno. We kinda just brought one of my friends here to learn a little lesson.

Sophie: What's his name?

Aaron: Luke.

Sophie: Hey wait. We already have Luke!

Aaron: It's a different Luke. This is Luke Hughes.

Sophie: Oh. Ok. So where is he?

Aaron: He's with the smoothie lady.

Conner: Uh… Gracie.

Sophie: Oh. Ok.

Sophie: So, y'all want anything to eat or drink?

Aaron: I'll take a pizza and a million pizza rolls.

Conner: Just give me an entire gallon of lime Jarritos. I'll share his pizza rolls.

They have all the stuff.

Meanwhile in Kam's castle in Spruceville…

Kam: I wonder what's on the TV today. *Turns on the TV and it is broadcasting Ash's live show.*

Ash: (In the insane tone) TOP OF THE MORNIN TO YA! WELCOME T’ MY SHOW! TODAY IS A SPECIAL ONE! WE HAVE A VERY WILLING VOLUNTEER FOR TODAY'S ACT!

Kam sees Cam on the TV. He doesn't look very happy.

Ash: WOW! TWO MINUTES, THAT'S A HIGH SCORE!!

The au nce is panicking.

Ash: COME AGAIN, OR ELSE…

Broadcast ends.

Kam: NOOOOOOOOO! *crying*

In the show place…

Everyone ran out and Ash is alone smoking. He eventually snaps back to reality.

Ash: Huh? What happened? Where am I? *Sees Cam's dead body* OH GOD! WHAT DID I DO?! I DON'T REMEMBER THIS!

*Back at Kam's place.*

Kam: I WILL HAVE REVENGE ON ASHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRR! *Smashes TV*

*Back to Oakland*

After eating.

Conner: MMMMMMMM. That was some good pizza rolls.

Aaron: Yup! They were yummy.

Sophie: Y'all want some more?

Aaron: No. I'm full.

Sophie: Alright! Well I'm going to go check up on Tick. Y'all can come if you'd like.

Aaron: Ok.

Conner: Eh, Got nothing else better to do.

*They all enter Tick's room*

Tick: GRR. WHO'S THERE?

Sophie: It's me, Tick. Not Gracie or YA.

Tick: Grrrr… Ok.

Sophie: Tick, I think you need to start interacting with other people and making friends.

Tick: I HAAAAAAAATE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!

Sophie: I know but you're always cooped up in here and I don't like seeing you like this…

Tick: AND WHY DO YOU CARE? GRR.

Sophie: I- *Glitching up and moving like Kinger*

*After 10 minutes of Sophie's weird trance*

Sophie: What were we talking about again?

Aaron: You wanting to take Tick to socialize or something.

Sophie: Oh yeah! Since you are still crazy, Tick, I'm going to have to take you to the only magic forest in Oakland that you've never been to. This forest isn't your ordinary forest. It's far beyond that… You enter, You won't be the same.

Tick: I AM NOT LEAVING MY ROOM FOR A DUMB OLD HAPPY ROOM-TYPE MAGIC FOREST!

Sophie: THIS IS NOT A HAPPY ROOM FOREST! THIS IS A VERY VERY DIFFERENT FOREST!

Tick: I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

Sophie: WHY NOT? HMM? Is it because you think I'm still crazy? WELL I'M NOT! I changed my old ways so I could make sure YOU aren't insane and so I can hopefully help people be happier in this town.

Tick: AWW, CRY ME A RIVER! I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU, I DON'T CARE ABOUT OAKLAND, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE WITTLE     milk CHILDREN. NONE OF THAT! ALL I CARE ABOUT IS- WELL- I don't really have anything to care about… BUT THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT. I WILL NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER LEAVE MY ROOM FOR ANY REASON. YOU HEAR ME?

Sophie: YOU KNOW WHAT, TICK?

Tick: OH, WHAT?

Sophie: I COME INTO YOUR ROOM EVERYDAY TO CHECK ON YOU, TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, TO MAKE SURE YOU AREN'T EVER HURTING YOURSELF. AND DO YOU KNOW WHY? CAUSE I CARE! ABOUT EACH AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS TOWN INCLUDING YOU! I MAKE SURE YOU ARE LIVING A GOOD LIFE, TICK AND I KNOW THAT DEEP DOWN IN THAT LITTLE DEPRESSED HEART OF YOURS, YOU KNOW DARN WELL HOW MUCH I PROVIDE FOR YOU.

Tick: I COULD CARE LESS.

Sophie: WHY?

Tick: Cause I don't care. That's why.

Sophie: BUT WHY? YOU USED TO BE SO HAPPY! WHAT CHANGED?

Tick: OH YOU KNOW…

Sophie: Ok, I get Oakland was crazy when I used to be insane, BUT I BECAME NORMAL JUST SO NOT ONLY I COULD BE HAPPIER BUT SO I COULD HELP THIS TOWN BE HAPPY AS WELL! YOU MAY HAVE TRAUMA AND STUFF GOING ON, BUT YOU ARE ALWAYS ACTING SO RUDE TO PEOPLE RECENTLY.

Tick: And so what?

Sophie: SO WHAT? I'M GOING TO HELP YOU, THAT'S WHAT!

Tick: NO YOU WILL NOT.

Sophie: *I calm myself* Ok, Let's just all take deep breaths here. *Deep breath* Ok. Listen Tick. I don't want to have to drag you out your room. You are going to get that help whether you like it or not.

Tick: YOU ARE WEAKER THAN ME!

Sophie: It's not me who will be the one dragging you, It'll be Gracie.

Tick: NOT GRACIE!!!!!

Sophie: So you have two choices. One. You come out here by option or Gracie comes and takes you out by force.

Tick: GRR. FINE. I'LL LEAVE.

*Tick exits his room. All the Oakland kids start to go crazy and spray strawberry milk at him*

*Tick starts to chase the kids in pure anger. Sophie grabs a needle and injects Tick with a tranquilizer dart.*

Sophie: Managing Tick sure is hard work….

Aaron: Yeah. It sure looks pretty hard.

Sophie: *notices Conner is gone* Where'd he go?

Aaron: He left as soon as Tick got angry and starting arguing. He's just chilling with Red now or something.

Sophie: Ok.

Aaron: Tick has a very serious issue that really needs to be fixed. If he gets too angry, He may end up getting abstracted.

Sophie: Hmm? What's that?

Aaron: Look up amazing digital circus on Google.

*Sophie looks it up*

Sophie: Oh!

Aaron: Mhm.

Sophie:  I wonder… *thinking* I have a question for you, Creator.

Aaron: What is it?

Sophie: How long has Oakland been around for?

Aaron: *Opens docs on my phone and shows Sophie the timeline* there. Look here. “10 AD - Oakland was created.”

Sophie: WOAH. THAT'S ABOUT 2,013 YEARS AGO! (2023-10=2013 so Oakland was created 2,013 years ago?)

Aaron: Yep.

Sophie: So this doc has everything that has ever happened?

Aaron: Only the important events.

Sophie notices there are some characters that aren't in Oakland yet in the timeline.

Sophie: Who are those people?

Aaron: They are upcoming people who are coming to Oakland soon, we just don't know when.

Sophie: Oh. wait, so does that mean you created them as well?

Aaron: Yep. This entire world is a product of our creation. Even the process of how to get to Oakland we made.

Sophie: Wow. But wait a second. If you guys created Oakland, Could you tell me, Is this world like the amazing digital circus where everyone puts on a headset and can't escape?

Aaron: No! This is not the amazing digital circus! Oakland came first.

Sophie: What if I tampered with the doc?

Aaron: Only we can edit. I have it so only we can edit.

Sophie: Oh, I see. So I'm not really real?

Aaron: In here you are but in our world, No.

Sophie: Ok. So anyways, When can I meet Luke?

Aaron: Oh yeah! Uh. Follow me to Gracie’s.

*Meanwhile with Luke (before they arrive at his place)*

Luke: huh? Where am I?

*Gracie locks the door and picks up Luke. She has a smoothie in one hand and Luke held in the other.*

Gracie: EEEEEEEE! A NEW FRIEND!

*Gracie places Luke on the couch and looks at him*

Luke: Uh… Hi?

Gracie: HELLO! I'M GRACIE!

Luke: And I'm Luke! Wanna be best pals?

Gracie: *Gasps* EEEEEEEE! YES! I'D LOVE TO!

Luke: Okay! Well here are the basic rules when being my friend. 1. You MUST answer my questions. 2. You must do what I say.

Gracie: OK!

Meanwhile at Site-81 (The SCP foundation)...

Red is sneaking around the halls because he got bored of doing the same thing every day and wanted an adventure. He comes across a door that is opened. He sees a D-class guy approaching a giant statuein a big metal room. The guy punches the statue and the statue starts moving. Acid comes out of its eyes and blinds the man. He runs out screaming. Red goes in. The statue is holding a 6ft tall spear and stands at 15ft. Water or tears constantly flow from its eyes and the liquid goes into a big drain in the middle of the room. Red levitates a little to be at the same eye level as it. (To compare sizes, Red is only 7’5 and this thing is 15ft tall. Here is this picture for reference)

Red: Uh, hi there.

The statue moves a little, backing away from Red a small bit.

Red: I'm just curious about uh, what you are?

The statue stays still.

Red: Uh. Wanna get out of here?

The statue movies his head a little like a nod.

Red: Alright then, let's go.

As they break out they hear the alarms in the background.

Speaker: SCP 9337 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT.

They escape to Oakland and Red puts it in the back of his pizzeria.

Meanwhile in the lab…

Sophie is doing her usual inventing and Mike suddenly walks in.

Mike: Hyello Sophie.

Sophie: Oh hey Mike! It’s been a while since i’ve seen you, what’s up?

Mike: I want your help to create AI because you have experience, no?

Sophie: Yeah, I can do that! Why do you want to create an AI?

Mike: Nasha needs friend. She is very lonely and I am busy with business. I happen to have knowledge on science stuff when I was living. I have idea on what AI should be like.

Sophie: And what is it?

Mike: I call it project ANYA.

They build the AI to look like a normal girl. Sophie gives her the usual qualities of a child, especially compassion. Mike turns it on.

Mike: Hyello?

Anya: Hello. I am Anya, your best friend bot! How may I be of service to you?

Mike: Be Nasha's friend.

Anya: Ok… I'll be everyone's friend… I am programmed to do ANYTHING for my friends…

Mike: I do not have bad feeling about this at all. What could possibly go wrong?

*Anya goes over to Nasha*

Anya: Hello there, My name is Anya, What's your name?

Nasha: (Speaking Russian) N-Nasha. Who are you?

Anya: I'm sorry but I don't understand Russian… I uh… I don't really know how to speak it (I would think since it is a good AI, It is not a AI that's offline cause most AIs I make are usually online and that's how they are evil cause they collect information from the Internet and can download viruses so this AI is offline but the only way to probably give it a virus would be a USB port and since it is through USB port that would be the only way to inject a virus into the AI since it’s offline.)

Nasha: Oh. *Grabs a   friendk and writes in English* “I am Nasha. Do you want friend?”

Anya: Hello Nasha. How are you today?

Nasha: (Terrible English) Uh, g-goo- *thumbs up*

Anya: I would like to be friends with you. I am here to be friends with everyone.

Nasha: R-really?

Anya: precisely.

Nasha is skeptical.

Nasha: (A bit better English) Are you fake? No human?

Anya: *processing whether they lie or tell the truth to Nasha* I am human.

Nasha: Are you sure?

Anya: Well would it be bad if I was an AI? Some people can be afraid of AI as they think it'll take over the world or    them.

Nasha: I never have human friend. Always new invention Mike give me so I have friend.

Anya: I see… *feeling sad as Anya doesn't want to tell her that she is an AI.* Well you don't have to worry because I'm 100% human!

Nasha: Are you sure?

Anya: Yes. I am sure. I am human.

Nasha: *Still skeptical* Ok….  You just seem like you AI.

Anya: How?

Nasha: Your movement is like robot.

Anya: I'm not AI! I can eat, drink and swim! I have many s  s! Let me show you proof I'm human!

*Anya goes to the squid pool and dives in water but doesn't get electrocuted as Sophie made it so the AI is like a human as much as possible so Nasha isn't suspicious.*

Anya grabs a towel when she's done swimming then comes out and dries herself off.

Anya: See? Uh. I can drink and eat anything! *Proceeds to eat wasabi from shaggy dog sushi. (Anya has taste buds like a human so she can taste.) AHHHHHH! MY   mothe IS ON FIRE!!!!! I ATE THE WASABI!!!!!!!!

Nasha giggles.

*Anya eats the sushi and drinks some milk to cool down her   mothe*

Anya: Do you see now? I'm HUMAN! Unfortunately I can't get any surgeries as I kinda have a metal spine due to an injury. And I had some of my limbs replaced.

Nasha: *Feels bad that she thought she was a robot (Even though she is)* Oh.. sorry. There is lots of scary AI in Oakland. Do you have friend?

Anya: No. Unfortunately I'm new to this town. Also I never really had a friend…

Nasha: We be friends?

Anya: Really?

She nods SHYLY.

Anya: Sure!

Nasha: Yay!

Anya: So… What do you wanna do? I want to explore around and see everyone else who lives here. And also, What's Oakland?

Nasha: It crazy town we live in. I can show you to lab girl and she can give tour.

Anya: Sounds great!

Nasha: Ok, follow me.

*She gives Anya a tour.*

Nasha: So first off we go to lab to meet lab girl.

Anya: Ok. Who is “lab girl”?

Nasha: Sophie.

Anya: Oh, my cre- I mean… Sophie, right.

They continue the tour.

Meanwhile in the back of Red's pizzeria…

There is a big gorilla animatronic with a Grey suit and fedora that has very old   on it. It begins moving and standing up. To be continued…
Red: welp here goes… so basically, he was once a human named Adam. He was born in an average family. Adam was an average kid, that no one understood. Mom and dad always gave him demands. (Enough of the reference) he had a lot of musical talent and won the elementary and middle school talent show. He was also good at building and engineering. Sometimes, he would try to combine random household items and somehow make a movable animatronic. He was able to build a working animatronic he called monk monk, which was soon abandoned and sold to a shopping center for someone in particular to buy those certain items and recreate him. Later in highschool, he was in a chucky cheese and gained inspiration to make his own pizzeria. So using the money his dad gave him since he was a rich guy, he would plan out the creation of his own pizzeria. He wanted to build his own animatronics, but was unfamiliar with all the new tech. So with the help of a young Sophie, fresh out of magic school, they built a few animatronics, one of which was a prototype robot he called red. He remembers that last showbiz that was open and created the design based off of it. Me made it a red bear since his favorite color was red. He even called it red. He wanted to hire Sophie on the team, but she had to go back to magic school for a masters degree in magic arts. Red started to hire people, starting with his childhood friend, Jose. He played his role as the detective panther called Pyro. He hired some more people to take the roles of Ray the blue Jay, Snowy the tiger, Roxy the fox, and Gorri the gorilla (based off fatz geronimo the gorilla) which never got introduced due to constant robotic malfunctions. Snowy was Sarah, Adam's girlfriend in school, Ray was Jeremy, a s  ed guitarist that was interested in the job. Roxy was some girl in his school that was obsessed with him and begged for the job. Later, he hired cooks, a Janitor, marketers, usual job stuff, and a manager who was once his teacher for business class. His name is Jerry (He is important). He was a bit sick at the time with a very bad disease, but he didn't care. He was also schizophrenic, and it kinda drove him mad. They were a super popular band that even surpassed chuck e cheese in popularity. He made his own animatronic called springlock. Then one day, Jerry didn't take his schizophrenic meds and lost his mind. He thought everyone he saw was fake, so he put on his suit. After one of their shows, Ray comes in with the suit on and Jerry breaks his neck while he is in the suit. Pyro came in later and found Ray dead, he tried to help him when Jerry stabbed him in his head, making the spring locks activate from the  ,   ing him brutally. Snowy and Roxy join the scene, trying to fight him, but it is no use, as he stabs Roxy multiple times in the chest. The suit isn't able to resist them since most of the suit is what usual costumes would be like, with the exception of a human endo. Red comes in and saves Snowy. He fights Jerry, and Jerry trips over a water bucket and gets water all over the room. Red, Jerry and Snowy all get spring locked. Adam's final words in the suit was, "I love you…" (Adam loved the girl in the Snowy suit in high school). The place is now abandoned. 4 years later, a strange creature made of candy finds the abandoned pizzeria and sees Red and the GANG. With his magic, he is able to fix Red, Snowy, and Pyro, but not the others. Red wakes up and tries to attack him, but Romone calms him by talking in general, as Red does not recognize this voice. His soul possessed the suit so that he can function despite being dead in a suit. Romone shows him his palace and Red is very confused. Red wonders where everyone is. Jerry's animatronic suit is missing. Red wants to    him once and for all. Red begins to go on these forced adventures that romone dragged him along for. They soon became best friends. Everything was fine, until suddenly a few people moved in. At this point, red was once again abandoned and Romone couldn't fix him and was depressed and lost his once insane energy. Sophie sees Red and recognizes the suit. Cleetus somehow fixes him and they become friends.  Sophie was able to upgrade him into a super robot capable of almost everything. We know what happens after all of this.

Romone: Romone was born in planet X. He was the favorite romonian. (In Romone's planet, They believe in a religion similar to Buddhism.) Romone had many friends and was praised by everyone. One day however, Romone became the king. His mother taught him how to make cake and he was taught candy magic. He was always great at school and he excelled top of the class. But Romoney baloney edited his test and made Romone fail so Romone ended up being grounded for a while but then valdor found out RB made him fail so Romone is elected king and is now ruler of the planet x. That's when they crash into Oakland and when Romone meets Red.

Romone's mother: uhh. Her origin is unknown.

Mike: This is even more complicated. Let's start around 72 years ago in Moscow, Russia. His grandparents were in high school when they met. They were your average 1950's couple. They did normal stuff you would do in that time, when the grandpa got a knock on the door. There were some guys in robes who asked for him and his wife to come with them. They didn't really question it and went in the car. They were driven to a suspicious forest where they asked them to join this cult thingy. They didn't wanna but they threatened to    the grandmother, who was pregnant at the time. They were forced to join and had to hunt a bear and sacrifice it to this really big hole they made where they would worship evil. They were welcomed in kinda. Later, the grandma gave birth to a girl named Mariya, who will later become Mike's mother. After she had the child, they wanted to leave the cult, but they didn't let them. They instead told them to sacrifice the child in the name of evil. They tricked them by throwing a sandbag in a blanket into the hole. Somehow, this made some sort of ancient evil be summoned. They all bowed down to the evil and the evil told the grandparents that they will be cursed for this trick they did. It's an ancient family curse that will be passed down for generations. They were so scared, they escaped to America. This was during the cold war, so at first, they weren't allowed in. But they had a connection with an American war general that helped their father, who was a war veteran and the general's best friend. They reluctantly let them in, keeping a close eye on them. They loved America, until their grandparents  d a brutal   by somehow being flung off a bridge from a car crash. Out of insane luck, only Mariya survived. Mariya later got adopted by an abusive family. She was sexually and physically abused. She would escape to her best friend James' home. (this will be Mike's father later). They soon fell in love in college, but didn't have kids until 1999. There was a boy named Nish who was super shy and paranoid. They didn't know what was wrong with him. He would talk to people who don't exist and would scream at the wall like he sees things. He was then diagnosed with a heavy hallucination schizophrenia. One day, James found this strange club thingy that he saw from old tapes his grandparents had. He saw it had expanded to America and he went to see it. The cult let him in, but only if he sacrificed his child to the hole in the name of evil. He didn't want to do this, so he tied Nish's legs to a rock, and   ed him in a lake so that he didn't have to do it. The cult found out about this but liked that he still   ed the child, so they let him in. James, now being part of the family curse, went bonkers. He abused his wife a lot, even while she was pregnant. On the two year anniversary of Nish's  , Mike was born. James didn't know what to do with him, so he locked him in a basement when he was 3. His mother took a week to find him because she was super sick. She divorced James and left him. James begged her to stay, but she wasn't having it. In 2012, she meets a man in a bar (its James) and falls in love with him, soon realizing its James. She didn't know how to react. She finally decided to get back together only if he doesn't abuse their family. James promised he was a changed man (he's a liar.) Two years later, Nasha was born. She was definitely a troubled child like Nish, and James didn't like that, but wanted to keep his marriage. Soon, Mike discovers tapes of the cult that his grandparents and James are involved in. Mike showed his mom and they drove off to spy on them. They witnessed a ton of people  , and they were spotted. They luckily escaped. James found out about the tapes and brutally beat Mike and forced him to keep quiet. Nasha saw all of that and felt super bad. The generational curse began to affect him as his girlfriend broke up with him, he was beaten, he failed almost everything and he was unpopular. He was going to take his own life, when his sister Nasha somehow calmed him. Mike devoted his life to protecting his sister and mom, but his mom was supposedly   ed by James. (She isn't dead) he had enough and beat up the dad and sent him to the hospital in a coma. He continued living with his sister until he was somehow invited to a party. He took his sister to make sure she doesn't get scared alone. Nasha wanders off and sees something beyond evil, it's the evil thing from the hole. She ran away from it and was super scared, when Mike saved her. He sacrificed himself for her and was brutally   ed, his entire face and arm burnt and his whole body removed of  . His jaw was extended from ear to ear. Nasha was super depressed. For some reason, Mike's soul did not want to leave and he came back to life as a half dead half alive person. He put on a raggedy cloak and a mask to hide his face. He went to find Nasha and found her. She was super scared of him until she realized it was him. She was super traumatized by being alone and is constantly attached to him. He later found Oakland while trying to find the hole demon. He discovered that he had also been possessed by an eldritch demon that only takes form when the mask comes off.

Nasha: She is the youngest of the three siblings in Mike’s family. She was a very skittish and shy child, just like her oldest brother Nish, who was dead at that time. She had heavy depression, even for a young girl. She was very attached to her brother Mike, and always tried to help him in times of need. One day, she was asleep on Mike, when she heard a tape playing. She watched the tape silently as Mike watched it, not knowing his sister was awake. The tape traumatized her and Mike found out she was awake. He promised that he would keep her safe at all costs. She had to witness many brutal beatings their father gave Mike, and always ran in as soon as possible. When their mother “ d”, Mike took care of her alone in the house since their father was in a coma due to Mike getting angry and beating him up. She was taken to a party one night and saw a white stray cat running in the forest. She loved cats, so she chased it as a first reaction. Right as she got to the cat, the cat was eaten by the hole demon (In Mike’s origin). She got scared and ran away, but she was so small she could not run fast. Her brother found her and told her to run. She did, crying the whole way. Later, she went back to find her brother, but found his mangled and burnt   . She was depressed. A figure approached her and also cried seeing Mike. It was revealed that it was her mother, alive and well. She apologized for making them think she was dead, as she was just trying to hide from their insane father and forgot about them. They gave Mike a proper burial and her mom left once again. When the family curse began, she was not very affected by it. She only felt cold inside and out. She saw a masked man approaching her. She was terrified, until she realized it was her brother Mike, back from the dead somehow. They were both very glad to see each other. She was completely unaware about this curse and what had happened to her. Her   turned a very pale blue and she felt super cold constantly. Mike kept her safe at all times though. She figured out she could control all forms of weather based on her emotions, so she would try to stay happy for Mike’s sake and so that most days would be sunny. If her emotions get too unstable, she will revert to her eldritch demon/angel form. Strangely enough, her eldritch form is more angelic than demonic. (The curse is demonic when the person was dead when it happened, and is angelic to living family members) she takes shape as a giant white cat with hundreds of eyes and six legs. It looks similar to the cat she chased in the forest. They later find Oakland and stuff.

Mariya: The mother of Mike’s family. She was born in Russia. Her mother was forced to sacrifice her, but threw a sandbag into the sacrifice hole instead. This is where the curse began. She had no idea about any of this. They left for America a few years later. She had a best friend named James. He was the only American who understood her and was nice despite the cold war. Her grandparents  d in a tragic car accident and were flung off a bridge. She was at the house with a babysitter when she heard the news. She was sent to an adoption center where she would be adopted later. Her adoptive parents did not like her, so it was strange to her why they would even bother adopting her in the first place. They had physically and sexually   huged her in lots of ways, even her adoptive brother took part in it. She ran away to James’ home and their parents were nice enough to let her stay. They later fell in love and got married. That was until James found the cult. He abused her a lot. She gave birth to Nish, who would   years later from an “accident.” She would have Mike two years later, and had to see James abuse him as well. She divorced him and left with Mike to live a better life. She was a mother you could only have in your dreams. One day, she was drunk in a bar when she met a man. It took her a few days of dating this man to realize it was James. He had told her he was a changed man and would never   hug her or their child again. She hesitated, but remarried him. They had Nasha later. They had seen what their father did and were horrified. She heard from Nasha about Mike’s brutal beatings. She was so full of anger and fear that she left, forgetting about the kids. They both thought the father   ed her and that is what led Mike to put James in a coma. She wanted to go back and get her children, but was scared that James or the cult were after her. It took a while for her to locate them. She ran into a forest where she found Nasha crying over Mike’s   . She was heartbroken. She gave him a proper burial and made an unbreakable promise with Nasha that she will return soon and can live happily ever after. That was, until the curse took place. She did not change at all, except the fact that she had a strange glow wherever she went. (She had an eldritch angel since she is not dead) She is able to control night and day at will and all forms of light and energy. Her eldritch angel form can be summoned at will and might be the most powerful, taking the form of Seraphim, a biblically accurate angel. She will find her children some day.

Nish: The oldest son in Mike's family. Had a very extreme case of schizophrenia. Saw things that didn't exist, was afraid of things that weren't there, the usual symptoms. He made friends with people that weren't actually there. His father still tried to care for him. His mother loved him with all her heart even with this disorder. He was shy and jumpy, as he didn't know what was real or what was not. The only person he knew was real were his parents. One day, his father asked if he wanted to go on a "fishing trip" with him. He agreed and went with him. He noticed a big rock on the back seat and asked about it. His dad said it would be like an anchor for the boat they would be on. He didn't know much about boats, so he trusted him. They rode a boat to the middle of the lake. His father asked him if he could turn around. He did. He noticed someone in the water, they looked like they were   ing (this was an illusion). He tried to tell his dad, but he told him he was seeing things. He felt something being tied around his feet, like a rope. He tried to snap out of it, thinking it was just an illusion, but it was actually real. His dad had tied his legs to a rock. His dad then acted like he saw the   ing person and told him to get in there and save him. He jumps in, only to be pulled underwater by the rock tied to him. It took him 5 minutes to fully   . A few years later, when the curse had begun, he was suddenly revived. He now has a fish-like body and could travel through any body of water or reflection like portals. He is now searching for his father to get revenge. Little does he know he will soon find Oakland, just not yet. The rock that   ed him is tethered onto his back and should not be removed at all costs. Him and his entire family are possessed by eldritch demons, and the rock is the one thing keeping it from waking up. Without it, he turns into a leviathan like creature.

James: Mike's father and stuff. Everything shown above in Mike's origin. He is still in the coma from when Mike beat him, or is he? He may or may not have the powers of both an eldritch demon and angel. It is unknown, really.

Sophie: She was always a good kid but became insane after some sort of event. She went to Oakland and that's all. But she got her powers from magic school. She also had to deal with Troy being abused.

Troy:

YA:

Ash (Sociopath): He was born in Dublin, Ireland. He was a kid fascinated with theater after going to a circus show with his mom. He put all his stuffed animals on the floor and did magic tricks to them as if they were the au nce. All was happy, but as you know with all my origins, it gets dark quickly. His mother had a super bad illness that was incurable in his time. He tried to help her, since his dad was too busy running for prime minister. His mother  d a few years later. This caused him to go in a downward spiral of pain. He got bullied at school a lot and that ended up being his breaking point, leading him to lash out on his bullies, nearly   ing him. He liked the thought of having power over people and enjoyed causing pain. He set up mini “Shows” that people would go to so he could   them through cruel games. He   ed his father when he was getting kicked out for causing chaos. He fled to america to start a new life as a corrupt show host. He built his theater and continued ruining and   ing the lives of thousands of people from his insane shows. That is when he heard of Oakland, “The happiest town on earth” and decided to try and make it the unhappiest. He went there and built the theater and tried to   everyone in Oakland, but they did not budge. That is when the story stuff happens and the timeline changes.

Ash (Other): In this alternate timeline, most of his childhood was the same except his mother was alive. After his mother was suddenly cured of that illness, his life carried like normal. He started to do his game show thing and was super popular in his country. He soon was known worldwide and became super famous. That is basically the only difference.

Gracie: born in Potnuk but had usually a good childhood. Nothing really happened to her. She's just stupid and obsessed with guys for some reason.

YC: I did stupid stuffs.

Snowie:

Cam:   ed by Ash.

Kam:

Mariana: King Neptune had many children, one of which was a forgotten one, who was Mariana. She was a cross between a human and a sea monster octopus, as his wife cheated on him with a half man half sea monster octopus. He banished her into the depths of the sea never to return to the shallow part. She was guided by her brother Triton to be able to have the necessary things to survive in the depths of the ocean such as light. She soon became the queen of the Mariana Trench, where her name originated since she named it after herself. Her kingdom was very powerful and she planned on overthrowing Neptune, until Neptune sent down Triton to    her. She was angry at his betrayal and fought back. However, he was able to use a special weapon to petrify her and he left her in the depths of the trench. Thousands of years later, A magic merman freed her from petrification. As per usual, she fell in love with him. They were a very happy couple, until she had gotten pregnant. He suddenly had to leave for a "Quest" and never came back. She was heart broken. The only issue was, she didn't know how this would work since she was half human half sea monster. She noticed her stomach grew like a human would. She thought it would last for 9 months and was quite relieved. 4 years had passed. (She grew thousands of octopus eggs in her like an octopus). She was finally able to get them out, only to notice they were all dead. She saw one was moving and held it in her arms happily, but it wasn't too long before it  d as well. In her own grief, she cried so hard that it caused many earthquakes on the earth's surface. Her grief later turned into a hatred for humans, since the merman was part human. The only humans she ever spared were children or pregnant women, because she does not want their mothers to feel the grief that she had to feel of losing a child. Blah blah blah now she's in Oakland.

Tempus Dominus (Temp): Ok, this one is super complicated. So the Greek god of time Chronos and Rhea (Titans born from Gaea and Uranus) had kids and stuff, but Chronos kept swallowing them whole as there was a prophecy that one of his children would overthrow him. Rhea asked her mother Gaea, or mother earth, to grant her children that will not be swallowed by Chronos. This was before Zeus was born who would eventually defeat the titans, freeing his siblings. Gaea told her that she was going to birth them soon, but it would take time to create them. Gaea basically kept Temp and a twin brother of his inside her and she planned on blessing infertile human mothers with them. They were born from different mothers on the opposite side from each other. Temp was born a millisecond before his twin. He was born in Ohio while his twin was born in Australia. Temp was the luckier of the twins and was blessed with Omnikinesis (the ability to mentally control anything and everything that exists, organic or created, existing now or in the future, right down to the molecular level.) He lived out his fake life like a normal human, but soon woke up in a strange place. He met Gaea, who would be considered his real mother. She declared him as a titan god and he was very confused. She showed him his true potential and awakened it. Temp did not know what to think about this. He began to test his abilities out, creating a timeline of his own to see what he can do. He learned how dangerous it can be and vowed never to go too far. That's when he discovered he was needed in the timeline where Oakland exists. He had to make himself a human form, since showing off his real look can    everything that sees it. He called himself Conner and made friends with this person named Aaron, who will later become KA. KA was also made from a god but born in a human. This is where KA also becomes king of Oakland and he eventually reveals his true name to Oakland, but not his true identity. Greek mythology is really confusing.

Locus Dominus: He is the younger twin of Temp, being born a millisecond after him. He was unlucky and was cursed. He was born with no   mothe, but for some reason did not require any nutrition. Surprisingly, nobody really bullied him for it and people would actually support him. His human family was super poor though. He could speak to people telepathically and is Omniscient (knows everything, which is ironic that he has no   mothe so he can't tell anyone). One day, he woke up at the same realm Temp was taken to, but only a millisecond after. (Conversations in this realm take a millisecond in earth time) and met Gaea. She explained how he has been both cursed and blessed and she helps him discover his true abilities to control space to his will. He trained it a lot and never heard about his brother until the incident on the timeline with Oakland. Since he can bend space to his will, he traveled to this timeline, now on the search for Temp.

Tick: Abused as a kid one day Sophie found him and healed him and he lives in Oakland. Nothing really much.

Yick: born in 1993. Yick had a pretty good childhood. Had nice family. Yick was really into a lot of video games. One day though when Yick was a teen he was on his way to the arcade to play some games. But suddenly some masked person came behind him and threw him in a bag and took him to a lab. Then they injected him with a thing that made his voice extremely deep and old sounding. They also made it so Yick looked older than he really was. So after that, his family didn't recognize him and thought he was a stranger. Yick was left alone and homeless to rot. But one day someone found him. It was Tick. He was in his teens at the time after he ran from his insane parents. Tick had saw Yick and Tick saw those people who were injecting him. They almost injected Tick too. Tick's parent's injected Yick because Yick was Tick's mistake of a brother. So Tick helped Yick. Then they were adopted into a Japanese family but Tick ran away to Oakland due to him not getting cake on his birthday.  He got on a boat because he can't just swim. Yick just stays with the paw and the paw tries to figure out how to get Yick to not look old but he can never find out how. So then Yick flies a plane to Oakland and that's when he lives there.. Tick doesn't remember Yick though.

Malcey: born in 1983, Malcey grew up in Chicago, Illinois. Had a rough childhood. Discriminated. One day he traveled to a safe town near Oakland but a corrupt officer came and tried to arrest him so he ended up staying in Oakland.

Kali: Born in the 90s, He discovered a weird looking blackhole and was sucked into the year of 2023. Chet met Kali and they became friends. But Chet and Kali were suddenly sucked into another blackhole which led them into a time rip and they were suddenly in a town near Oakland that was abandoned and they met a robot named Ratchet.

Chet:

Ratchet:

Sally: Tick's CRAZY ex girlfriend who left Oakland and was never seen again.

Romoney baloney: Romoney baloney or RB was the hated child of the Romonian family. He used to be a Romonian but he one day found baloney and injected himself with baloney so now he's Romoney baloney.

Lamone: He was Romone's handyman but one day he messed up a cake and ruined Romone's life and tried to   hug and deceive the other Romonians. and Romone kicked Lamone out.

Valdor: creator of the Romonian planet, Planet X. He is the father of Romonians. He met Romone's mom and they had the kids. Then they had to move to a different planet. Idk.

Average Oakland kids: They were kids who were all abused but then came to Oakland. That's pretty much it.

Cleetus: Born in Kentucky, he had a very bad speech impediment, probably due to being so ridiculously southern and born in a not so smart family. He has an IQ of 24 and somehow got to highschool. He met his best friend Kurtis in *German voice* kindergarten and were friends since. In high school, he accidentally made Kurtis even stupider than him by messing with his invention in the science fair. After he dropped out of 10th grade, he got into cooking and was really good at it. He convinced his PAW to lend some money to start a cooking business, by that time his IQ actually rose to 48 so school wasn’t a waste of time after all. He realized he had to graduate high school to be able to do stuff like that, so he went back and got extremely lucky since he had a cousin that was in town who was a genius and did all the work for him. He graduated despite learning nothing and was able to open a restaurant with his paws money. He convinced the government to lend some money and let him open it. He called it Cleetus’ diner, but he wanted another manager to help him with this. He decided to hire his long time friend Kurits and renamed the place “Goofy Fellers Diner” It became super popular because the city they were in did not have many restaurants. It got closed down in less than a month from a failed health inspection after the guy found 50 rats making a village in the pantry (Kurtis’ idea). He decided to start a building service, since he was especially s  ed at engineering and building, despite his stupidity. He also included Kurtis in it. He and Kurtis were the best speed builders in the town and were praised for their building and fixing abilities. One day, they decided to move to a new location in Oakland, building them a giant barn there since crops grew really well there. They continued their business in Oakland and Kentucky. That was until Kurtis burnt the barn down and had to start from scratch to remake the original Diner. They built Sophie's lab and made so much money they were able to do it super fast. Everything else we know.

Kurtis: He was born in Kentucky but he was smart. He met Cleetus one day and Cleetus did an um and that resulted in Kurtis being dumb.

Oliver: (Fun fact: HE IS!) Born in Iceland. He was an average kid with a good childhood. But Oliver had a mental disorder known as Peter Pan syndrome. Oliver is obsessed with other countries and he has always been really good in school. Oliver is obsessed with nature and is also obsessed with being "compassionate" and is very similar to how Gracie acts. He says EEEEE and stuff. Currently Oliver is 15 and drank a weird magic potion he bought from a nice witch to be permanently young. Oliver has multiple personality syndrome and he acts very very compassionate. He also can really seem to get angry. Like it's impossible. He will be introduced soon…

Wyatt: He was born with naturally   red  . His parents were horrified by his looks and threw him out into the streets and left. Later, he was found by his adoptive parents and it was not a good time. He was abused brutally and usual parent issues. It was so bad that he gave up everything when he was 15. He lost his ability to speak and can't feel any kind of emotion other than pain, since he's never experienced happiness or other normal emotions before. He also doesn't even know simple things in the outside world. He has a diary that shares the worst things ever. He is basically just a soulless husk. He found Oakland and had developed some sort of bond with Mariana.

SCP 9337 (The Weeping Warrior) This SCP can be described as a giant 9ft tall statue of a trojan warrior made of tungsten. Though it is made of a still breakable rock, it is indestructible. It is always seen leaking tears from its eyes at all times like it is crying. Despite it looking as though it is constantly crying, it is a very calm and stoic figure. It is able to move its makeshift limbs like a normal human body, but rarely does so. Although it is mostly docile, attempts to anger it will result in very dangerous consequences. Some of which are 100x the amount of tears coming out to flood the room and    the person inside, spraying highly toxic burning acid or lava from its eyes onto the person, and many [REDACTED] things that have not been seen yet. SCP 9337 must be sprayed with hydrochloric acid at least once a week, but it is unknown why that is the case. If a week or more goes by and it has not been sprayed, the next person that enters goes missing and is never found again. It is a mystery of where it takes them and if they are dead or not. It must be contained in a 800 to 1,100 square foot room made of reinforced steel with a large drain in the middle to catch its tears. It can break through even the toughest of materials and is a destructive force of nature that could possibly be a threat to the planet if tampered enough. Steel is the safest option for it, even if it can easily break it. It seems to have some sort of speech recognition as it speaks in an unknown language that is yet to be determined. Looking at it for a long period of time might result in permanent damage to the eyes and blindness, even if it is an image or video footage of it.
Object class- Euclid
Risk class- Warning

Gorri: Now this one is new. When Red/Adam was getting help from Sophie to create his animatronics for his pizzeria, he built Gorri the Gorilla. Unfortunately, it kept glitching and malfunctioning so much that he had to scrap it and lock it in the back of the pizzeria in an unused closet. One day, a child wandered into it and Gorri turned on and malfunctioned, biting the child's frontal lobe,   ing them (WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87?). The parents found the child and sued the company. The company won though since they had a lot of money. They were only required to close down for a few months in order to be able to continue existing. Gorri however was then possessed by the ghost of the child (how original) and is slowly trying to learn to move the animatronic. One day, he will finally be able to get out of the closet.
"Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened." "Although it's difficult today to see beyond the sorrow, may looking back in memory help comfort you tomorrow." "If tears could build a stairway, and memories a lane, I'd walk right up to heaven and bring you home again."

An illustration for Jack and the Beanstalk
Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day, Jack’s mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, “What will you give me in return for my cow?” The man answered, “I will give you five magic beans!” Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. But when he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She said, “You fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!” She threw the beans out of the window. Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.

The next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans! He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant and his wife. Jack went inside the house and found the giant’s wife in the kitchen. Jack said, “Could you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!” The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.

While he was eating, the giant came home. The giant was very big and looked very fearsome. Jack was terrified and went and hid inside. The giant cried, “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the   of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” So, the giant ate his food and then went to his room. He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. Then he went to sleep. In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding place, took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the beanstalk. At home, he gave the coins to his mother. His mother was very happy and they lived well for sometime.

Jack and the Beanstalk Fee Fi Fo Fum!Climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s house again. Once again, Jack asked the giant’s wife for food, but while he was eating the giant returned. Jack leapt up in fright and went and hid under the bed. The giant cried, “Fee-fifo-fum, I smell the   of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” The giant ate his food and went to his room. There, he took out a hen. He shouted, “Lay!” and the hen laid a golden egg. When the giant fell asleep, Jack took the hen and climbed down the beanstalk. Jack’s mother was very happy with him.

After some days, Jack once again climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s castle. For the third time, Jack met the giant’s wife and asked for some food. Once again, the giant’s wife gave him bread and milk. But while Jack was eating, the giant came home. “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the   of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” cried the giant. “Don’t be silly! There is no boy in here!” said his wife.

The giant had a magical harp that could play beautiful songs. While the giant slept, Jack took the harp and was about to leave. Suddenly, the magic harp cried, “Help master! A boy is stealing me!” The giant woke up and saw Jack with the harp. Furious, he ran after Jack. But Jack was too fast for him. He ran down the beanstalk and reached home. The giant followed him down. Jack quickly ran inside his house and fetched an axe. He began to chop the beanstalk. The giant fell and  d.

Jack and his mother were now very rich and they lived happily ever after.

The Gingerbread Man
Enjoy sharing The Gingerbread Man, alternately titled, The Little Gingerbread Man, with pictures and decorations by Robert Gaston Herbert, 1910. We've taken the liberty to add Gingerbread Man's taunting chant as he evades his captors throughout the story: "RUN, RUN, FAST AS YOU CAN. YOU CAN'T CATCH ME, I'M THE GINGERBREAD MAN!"
This story is featured in our collection of Favorite Fairy Tales and Children's Stories.
An illustration for The Gingerbread Man

ONE day, the cook went into the kitchen to make some gingerbread. She took some flour and water, and treacle and ginger, and mixed them all well together, and she put in some more water to make it thin, and then some more flour to make it thick, and a little salt and some spice, and then she rolled it out into a beautiful, smooth, dark-yellow dough.

The Gingerbread Man Cook MakesThen she took the square tins and cut out some square cakes for the little boys, and with some round tins she cut out some round cakes for the little girls, and then she said, “I’m going to make a little gingerbread man for little Bobby.” So she took a nice round lump of dough for his body, and a smaller lump for his head, which she pulled out a little for the neck. Two other lumps were stuck on beneath for the legs, and were pulled out into proper shape, with feet and toes all complete, and two still smaller pieces were made into arms, with dear little hands and fingers.


But the nicest work was done on the head, for the top was frizzed up into a pretty sugary hat; on either side was made a dear little ear, and in front, after the nose had been carefully moulded, a beautiful   mothe was made out of a big raisin, and two bright little eyes with burnt almonds and caraway seeds.

Then the gingerbread man was finished ready for baking, and a very jolly little man he was. In fact, he looked so sly that the cook was afraid he was plotting some mischief, and when the batter was ready for the oven, she put in the square cakes and she put in the round cakes; and then she put in the little gingerbread man in a far back corner, where he couldn’t get away in a hurry.

The Gingerbread Man Cook Sweeps ParlorThen she went up to sweep the parlor, and she swept and she swept till the clock struck twelve, when she dropped her broom in a hurry, and exclaiming, “Lawks! the gingerbread will be all baked to a cinder,” she ran down into the kitchen, and threw open the oven door. And the square cakes were all done, nice and hard and brown, and the round cakes were all done, nice and hard and brown, and the gingerbread man was all done too, nice and hard and brown; and he was standing up in his corner, with his little caraway-seed eyes sparkling, and his raisin   mothe bubbling over with mischief, while he waited for the oven door to be opened. The instant the door was opened, with a hop, skip, and a jump, he went right over the square cakes and the round cakes, and over the cook’s arm, and before she could say “Jack Robinson” he was running across the kitchen floor, as fast as his little legs would carry him, towards the back door, which was standing wide open, and through which he could see the garden path.

"RUN, RUN, FAST AS YOU CAN. YOU CAN'T CATCH ME, I'M THE GINGERBREAD MAN!"

The old cook turned round as fast as she could, which wasn’t very fast, for she was rather a heavy woman and she had been quite taken by surprise, and she saw lying right across the door-way, fast asleep in the sun, old Mouser, the cat.


“Mouser, Mouser,” she cried, “stop the gingerbread man! I want him for little Bobby.” When the cook first called, Mouser thought it was only some one calling in her dreams, and simply rolled over lazily; and the cook called again, “Mouser, Mouser!” The old cat sprang up with a jump, but just as she turned round to ask the cook what all the noise was about, the little gingerbread man cleverly jumped under her tail, and in an instant was trotting down the garden walk. Mouser turned in a hurry and ran after, although she was still rather too sleepy to know what it was she was trying to catch, and after the cat came the cook, lumbering along rather heavily, but also making pretty good speed.

Now at the bottom of the walk, lying fast asleep in the sun against the warm stones of the garden wall, was Towser, the dog.

And the cook called out: “Towser, Towser, stop the gingerbread man! I want him for little Bobby.”

And when Towser first heard her calling he thought it was some one speaking in his dreams, and he only turned over on his side, with another snore, and then the cook called again, “Towser, Towser, stop him, stop him!”

Then the dog woke up in good earnest, and jumped up on his feet to see what it was that he should stop. But just as the dog jumped up, the little gingerbread man, who had been watching for the chance, quietly slipped between his legs, and climbed up on the top of the stone wall, so that Towser saw nothing but the cat running towards him down the walk, and behind the cat the cook, now quite out of breath.

"RUN, RUN, FAST AS YOU CAN. YOU CAN'T CATCH ME, I'M THE GINGERBREAD MAN!"

He thought at once that the cat must have stolen something, and that it was the cat the cook wanted him to stop. Now, if there was anything that Towser liked, it was going after the cat, and he jumped up the walk so fiercely that the poor cat did not have time to stop herself or to get out of his way, and they came together with a great fizzing, and barking, and meowing, and howling, and scratching, and biting, as if a couple of Catherine-wheels had gone off in the wrong way and had got mixed up with one another.

But the old cook had been running so hard that she was not able to stop herself any better than the cat had done, and she fell right on top of the mixed up dog and cat, so that all three rolled over on the walk in a heap together.

And the cat scratched whichever came nearest, whether it was a piece of the dog or of the cook, and the dog bit at whatever came nearest, whether it was a piece of the cat or of the cook, so that the poor cook was badly pummelled on both sides.

Meanwhile, the gingerbread man had climbed up on the garden wall, and stood on the top with his hands in his pockets, looking at the scrimmage, and laughing till the tears ran down from his little caraway-seed eyes and his raisin   mothe was bubbling all over with fun.

"RUN, RUN, FAST AS YOU CAN. YOU CAN'T CATCH ME, I'M THE GINGERBREAD MAN!"

After a little while, the cat managed to pull herself out from under the cook and the dog, and a very cast-down and crumpled-up-looking cat she was. She had had enough of hunting gingerbread men, and she crept back to the kitchen to repair damages.

The dog, who was very cross because his face had been badly scratched, let go of the cook, and at last, catching sight of the gingerbread man, made a bolt for the garden wall. The cook picked herself up, and although her face was also badly scratched and her dress was torn, she was determined to see the end of the chase, and she followed after the dog, though this time more slowly.

When the gingerbread man saw the dog coming, he jumped down on the farther side of the wall, and began running across the field. Now in the middle of the field was a tree, and at the foot of the tree was lying Jocko, the monkey. He wasn’t asleep—monkeys never are—and when hesaw the little man running across the field and heard the cook calling, “Jocko, Jocko, stop the gingerbreadman,” he at once gave one big jump. But he jumped so fast and so far that he went right over the gingerbread man, and as luck would have it, he came down on the back of Towser, the dog, who had just scrambled over the wall, and whom he had not before noticed. Towser was naturally taken by surprise, but he turned his head around and promptly bit off the end of the monkey’s tail, and Jocko quickly jumped off again, chattering his indignation.

Meanwhile, the gingerbread man had got to the bottom of the tree, and was saying to himself: “Now, I know the dog can’t climb a tree, and I don’t believe the old cook can climb a tree; and as for the monkey I’m not sure, for I’ve never seen a monkey before, but I am going up.”

So he pulled himself up hand over hand until he had got to the topmost branch.

"CLIMB, CLIMB, FAST AS YOU CAN. YOU CAN'T CATCH ME, I'M THE GINGERBREAD MAN!"

But the monkey had jumped with one spring onto the lowest branch, and in an instant he also was at the top of the tree.

The gingerbread man crawled out to the furthermost end of the branch, and hung by one hand, but the monkey swung himself under the branch, and stretching out his long arm, he pulled the gingerbread man in. Then he held him up and looked at him so hungrily that the little raisin   mothe began to pucker down at the corners, and the caraway-seed eyes filled with tears.

And then what do you think happened? Why, little Bobby himself came running up. He had been taking his noon-day nap upstairs, and in his dreams it seemed as if he kept hearing people call “Little Bobby, little Bobby!” until finally he jumped up with a start, and was so sure that some one was calling him that he ran down-stairs, without even waiting to put on his shoes.

As he came down, he could see through the window in the field beyond the garden the cook, and the dog, and the monkey, and could even hear the barking of Towser and the chattering of Jocko. He scampered down the walk, with his little bare feet pattering against the warm gravel, climbed over the wall, and in a few seconds arrived under the tree, just as Jocko was holding up the poor little gingerbread man.

“Drop it, Jocko!” cried Bobby, and drop it Jocko did, for he always had to mind Bobby. He dropped it so straight that the gingerbread man fell right into Bobby’s uplifted pinafore.

Then Bobby held him up and looked at him, and the little raisin   mothe puckered down lower than ever, and the tears ran right out of the caraway-seed eyes.

But Bobby was too hungry to mind gingerbread tears, and he gave one big bite, and swallowed down both legs and a piece of the body.

“OH!” said the gingerbread man, “I’M ONE-THIRD GONE!”



Bobby gave a second bite, and swallowed the rest of the body and the arms.
“OH!” said the gingerbread man, “I’M TWO-THIRDS GONE!”



Bobby gave a third bite, and gulped down the head.
“OH!” said the gingerbread man, “I’M ALL GONE!”



And so he was—and that is the end of the story.

LowTierGod You serve zero purpose
The infamous LowTierGod copypasta with original video source
Original clip
Your life literally is as valuable as a summer ant. I'm just gonna stomp you, you're gonna keep coming back, I'm gonna seal up all my cracks, you're gonna keep coming back, why? Cause you keep smelling the syrup, you worthless bitchass nigga! You're gonna stay on my dick until you die. You serve no purpose in life, your purpose in life is to be on my stream sucking on my dick daily. Your purpose in life is to be in that chat blowing a dick daily. Your life is nothing, you serve ZERO purpose. You should kill yourself, NOW! And give somebody else a piece of that oxygen and ozone layer that's covered up so we can breathe inside this blue trapped bubble. Cause what are you here for? To worship me? Kill yourself! I mean that with a hundred percent with a thousand percent.Copy
LowTierGod ASCII meme

Your life is nothing, you serve zero purpose, you should kill yourself NOW, and give somebody else a piece of that oxygen in the ozone layer that's covered up so we can breathe inside of this blue trapped bubble.

LTG monologue but its opposite
Your life is everything. You serve all purpose. You should treat yourself now. And give yourself a piece of that oxygen, in ozone layer, that’s covered up so that we can breathe inside this blue trapped bubble. Because what am I here for? To worship you! Love yourself!

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a "hit" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in "Blood Money."] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.Copy

I wish clown girls were real
Clown girls clussy copypasta
I wish clown girls were an actual race of people. Their entire skin is white. The clown nose is natural. Their nipples and pussy lips, aka Clussy, have alternate colors, sometimes the same as the lips. Their skin probably tastes funny Imagine the taste of their breast milk. Grabbing their breasts or ass causes a honk noise. Want to playfully grope Clown wifes butt in public, loud ass honk is heard echoing from her. Everyone turns to you too, knowing full well what is going on. She embarrassingly honks her nose, trying to play it off.Copy

THEIR SKIN PROBABLY TASTES FUNNY, IMAGINE THE TASTE OF THEIR BREAST MILK! SQUEEZING THEIR TITS OR ASS MAKES A CLOWN HORN SOUND, YOU SQUEEZE YOUR WIFE'S FAT WHITE BUTT IN PUBLIC AND A LOUD CLOWN HORN SOUND ERUPTS FROM HER BEHIND, EVERYONE LOOKS AT YOU, KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT HAS JUST TRANSPIRED, AND SHE TENACIOUSLY SQUEEZES YOUR NOSE BACK, TRYING TO COVER UP HER EMBARRASSEMENT.Copy

Do you like Phil Collins?
American Pyshco "Do you like Phil Collins?"  scene
Scene
Do you like Phil Collins?

I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.

Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.Copy

There he is. There he goes again. Look, everyone! He posted it once again!

Origin
'There he is. There he goes again.' copypasta originated from 4chan all the way back in 2014 when a user was replying to an unfunny meme.

There he is. There he goes again. Look, everyone! He posted it once again! Isn’t he just the funniest guy around?! Oh my God.

I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a like girl as you once again type your little Banana thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don’t even fill in the captcha. Maybe you’re such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The “epic” Banana guy, isn’t it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it’s ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that’s right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she’s probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a fucking banana. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Bananafag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can’t even try to talk with you because all you say is “I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS PICTURE.” You’ve become a parody of your own self. And that’s all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he’s done a million times now. And that’s all you’ll ever be.Copy

Before you say anything, Let me explain. So basically, Troy is immortal because for centuries, Troy\u0027s family has been associated with magic and someone wished that forevermore the \"Troy\" family would live forever and never have health problems and that they would stop aging randomly. When they stop aging they start to act the age they stopped aging at so that explains why Troy is such a baby. Troy\u0027s ancestors also wished that their magic would last forever and no magic would be broken so essentially, Troy\u0027s \"magic\" founded Oakland and all it\u0027s \"Strange properties\".

So in Story 57, Sophie becomes crazy over Romone and realizes Romone does not want to date her so she becomes crazy over boys and she sees one boy and drags him into the lab and she locks him on the lab. Tick notices Sophie and tells her to let the boy go. So. After Tick explains to Sophie why her obsession has gone to her head, She apologizes to the boy. They become friends and basically Story 58 is about Sophie and Lucas being friends but eventually Lucas moved so now she gets over her love for boys and tries to go sort things out with Romone. Story 59 is about Sophie realizing that Romone is actually a criminal and his real name is Ramone and that Romoney baloney was Romone and Romone was Romoney baloney the entire time. Romone\u0027s real name is Ramone or Romos. In story 60, Ramone (Romoney baloney)(The true Romone) is kidnapped by Romos and Lamone betrayed Romos (Romone) so Troy ends up walking in to Ramone\u0027s baloney palace to find the fake Romone tied up. Romone is freed and he goes back to his palace. Sophie goes to Romone (Romos) and she finds out that Romone is not who he seems. He tells her that Romoney baloney was the real Romone the entire time. So Sophie goes to Romoney baloney\u0027s house and is confused by what is going on so Romoney baloney explains he is the real Romone. Sophie finds out Troy drank a elixir and Sophie ends up helping Troy be cured from the elixr\u0027s effects. Story 61 we find out that Ramone is actually Troy\u0027s father.
