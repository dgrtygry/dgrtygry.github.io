It is another boring day in Oakland and red is performing in a Christmas show at his pizzeria. This is the first time this place has had a show in months. They have just finished the show and everyone is cleaning up.


Cleetus: Thats was a nice showsum red! I loves the part when you said y'all!


Red: Thank you my friend.


Sophie: That was really a great show. Wait what? *someone handcuffs her* I guess I gotta go back to the asylum. See ya red!


They take Sophie away and Troy cries because he is all out of Strawberry milk.


Tick Slaps Troy because he's annoying and Troy starts to destroy the pizzeria. Red had enough and let out a high pitched roar that shook all of Oakland. He kicked everyone out and closed the restaurant.


One month later…


Sophie was finally free from the asylum and went back to her lab. Troy was forced to go to school. Let's see what happens there…


Troy: I DON'T WANNA GO TO SCHOOL


Tick: I DON'T CARE. GET IN THE BUS OR NO STRAWBERRY MILK.


Troy: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


Bus driver: Do we have a problem?


Tick: No no. I'm sorry, Troy has… issues. Let me just…


Tick throws Troy into the bus and the bus drives away. They soon arrive at school and Troy is kicked off the bus because he wouldn't stop screaming. He slowly inches closer to the school, afraid of what's gonna happen there. He eventually goes inside and is instantly greeted by the principal.


Mr Sanchez: why hello there! You're Troy, right? It is nice to finally meet you. My name is Mr Sanchez, and I'm the principal of the school. It is always a pleasure to meet a new student here at Oakland middle school. Let me guide you to your home room if you'd like.


Troy: O-Ok.


Troy follows the principal as they show Jim around. As he does that, kids look at him strangely and it freaks him out and hides.


Mr Sanchez: hey what's the matter?


Troy: th-those kids are staring at me!!


Mr sanchez: They are only staring because you are new. Do not worry about them. Let's go to your class.


A lot of useless stuff happen in between i'll just skip to when he gets home. Through the day, he got bullied and beat up multiple times and got detention for throwing chocolate milk everywhere because they didn't have strawberry milk. Troy cries in his pillow.


After school, A month passes and many crazy things start to happen. Firstly, The watcher reappears and enslaves people and lastly, Troy is kicked out of school for being too stupid. We now go to Cleetus talking to the watcher.


Cleetus: Uhhhhhhh Hey Mr weird floating guy, Where are wes?


The watcher : IT'S KYLE.


Cleetus: Uh. Mr. Keyhole… Uh-


The watcher : IT'S KYLE. "KUH EYE OL". SAY IT WITH ME.

The watcher : *Resets Oakland.* Oh, I'm so scared!


Tick: *Appears back in my room and wakes up.* HEY! I'M GOING TO GET THAT WATCHER! I'LL BEAT HIM UP.


*The watcher appears* 


The watcher : Wanna beat me? Nah. You can't beat me.


Tick: YOU MAY BE STRONG, BUT YOU ARE STILL HUMAN…


The watcher : Oh, I'm so scared!


Tick: FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN.


The watcher : Ok but only because you asked! 


*The Watcher turns off his powers.*


The watcher : Alright Tucky. Let's fight.


Tick: MY NAME IS NOT TUCKY! *Beats up the watcher.*


The watcher : *Gets weaker.* NO! If I can't control people then… I GET WEAKER! AH! I'M GETTING WEAKER!


Tick: *Continues beating up the watcher. Everyone else joins in.*


The watcher : *My powers are now gone permanently.* I BETTER RESET THE WORLD - OH NO! I CAN'T RESEET THE WORLD!


*The watcher explodes and the border breaks. Everyone is finally free.*


Sophie : I'm free!


Tick: We're all freeeeeeee!


Troy: I'm going to miss this place…


Tick: We aren't leaving. We're obviously staying.


Troy: Yay!


Tick: Things will be different around here though.


Sophie : Yeah. No more Strawberry milk after this.


Troy: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÀAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!


Sophie : Instead, You'll be having something healthier.


Troy: WAWAWAWAWAWAWWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWA!


Sophie : No more emotions. We all liked it when you are quiet and behaved. Oh and I'm turning you into a dog, Troy.


Troy: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

Troy was red


Dun dun dun… to be continued…



*There was a boy who was 13. There was also a girl who was 10. These two kids lived together. The boy would always get teased by the girl. One day, The boy became silent. He would avoid the girl completely. The boy was named Kyle and the girl was named Cecilia. Let's see what happens next!


*Present day*


Cecila: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Tries to find Kyle. I can't find him. I notice a note at the front door. It's from Kyle.* A note? Not again… Probably ANOTHER STUPID NOTE ABOUT WORK OR HOW HE'S "Sorry"... WHAT A PATHETIC DISGUSTING BROTHER I HAVE.


*The note reads "Hello, Ceceila. If you are reading this, Well, I'm leaving. I'm going to do what you told me to do! Jump off a bridge and die! I'm going to never be around you again. I'm going to leave. You'll never see me again. Goodbye forever."*


Cecila : I don't give a crap if he's dead!


*Meanwhile with Kyle.*


Kyle: Well, Time to die…


*Someone notices Kyle about to jump. The person grabs Kyle and hugs him.*


Samantha: Sir, Please tell me, Why did you want to jump?


Kyle: My family doesn't care about me.


Samantha: But you are so young! You have so much to learn.


Kyle: Nobody gives a care about me.


Samantha: Well I "give a" care about you.


Kyle: Really?


Samantha: Yeah. How about I take you to my house? It's pretty close by to where we are!


Kyle: O-Okay.


*Samantha takes Kyle to his house.*


Samantha: Well, Here we are?


Kyle: WE ARE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD! Are you my neighbor?


Samantha: I guess so?


Kyle: My family lives here…


Samantha: Don't worry. I'll protect you from your family.


Kyle: Thank you.


*A few days later.*


Kyle: Hey Samantha?


Samantha: Yeah?


Kyle: You know that one show called the story series?


Samantha: Mhm, What about it?


Kyle: Can we try to revive it?


Samantha: Well I happen to know the creator so yeah! 


Kyle: Ok!


*Meanwhile with Cecilia*


Cecila : I miss mom and dad… Now that Kyle is gone… I can't talk to anyone… I didn't mean to hurt him! I thought I was joking with him! Well, It's too late for me to apologize to Kyle since he's dead. *Cries* I miss Kyle!


*Cecila pulls herself together.*


Cecila : Maybe I'll go on a walk. That'll clear my head!


*Cecila walks out of her house. She decides to see what her neighbor is up to. Cecila knocks on the neighbor's door.*


Samantha: *Hears the knock.* Oh! I'll get it!


*Samantha answers the door. Kyle sees Cecilia and hides under his bed.*


Samantha: Hi! How can I help you, Neighbor?


Cecila : I want to talk about something…


Samantha: Have you been crying?


Cecila : Yeah. I miss my family…


Samantha: Come on in. I'll make you some Strawberry milk. Maybe my friend can cheer you up or something.


Cecila : That'd be nice.


*Cecila comes in Samantha's house and makes herself comfy.*


Samantha: I'll get you some Strawberry milk.


Cecila : Ok.


*Cecila looks around.* I really miss mom and dad…


*Kyle covers his ears.*


Kyle: Ugh. All she cared about was mom… I'm not listening to anything.


Cecila : I also cared about my brother, Kyle. He means the world to me.


Samantha: Sounds like you have a nice family.


Cecila : Yeah. I just miss them.


Samantha: You know, What's funny is I have a friend called Kyle!


Cecila : What. Take me to him!


Samantha: *Brings Cecilia into the guest bedroom.* He should be in here somewhere- *Sees Kyle under the bed and drags him out from under the bed.*


Kyle: *Tries to hold on but is lifted up and revealed to Cecilia.*


Cecila : It really is him… I thought he died!


Samantha: Huh? What do you mean?


*Kyle runs out the room.*


Cecila : Great. He ran out of the room. Well, That Kyle is my brother.


Samantha: He told me some things about you…


Cecila : I know. I've been awful to him but I decided to become nicer and I wanted to apologize to him.


Samantha: That's good. Maybe you can invite him for dinner at your house?


Cecila : He'll just run off when he sees me.


Samantha: Oh. Maybe I can keep him still?


Cecila: He'll be scarred for life if he sees me. He'll think we're bullying him.


Samantha: Can we both hug him then?


Cecila : Maybe that'll work but I don't know if he'll be ok with that…


Samantha: Ok. Well, let's try it. I'll go in first.


*Kyle can overhear the conversation.*


*Samantha comes into Kyle's room.


Kyle: *Screams and runs around the room.*


Samantha: Kyle! It's okay! It's just me!


*Samantha grabs Kyle and hugs him. Cecila comes into the room and hugs Kyle.*


Kyle: *Screams and squirms around. Shaking violently.*


Samantha: Kyle! We're just trying to hug you! Please calm down!


Kyle: *Doesn't stop.*


Samantha: PLEASE CALM DOWN!


Cecila : I don't think he likes this…


Samantha: This clearly isn't working. *Lets Kyle free.*


Kyle: *Runs off. Goes under my bed.*


Cecila : I think I may have one other solution to our problem.


Kyle: What is it?


Cecila : There was this old show that Kyle used to watch called The Story Series. It ended a week ago. Maybe if we revive it then we can get some answers from the characters on what to do.


Samantha: Ok. *Turns on a TV* No way… It says here that somebody already revived the story series! I think I have a idea. Ok so hear me out. If we can replicate Sophie's magic staff, Then we could travel to Oakland through a portal and have Sophie fix Kyle, and thus, We'd be featured on a Story Series show!


Cecila : But the author clearly says that it ended!
Samantha: Let's go pay the author a visit…


*Samantha goes to Aaron's house.*


Samantha: Excuse me, Is this where the author of the story series lives?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Why yes it is! The name's Aaron. Aaron. J. Hebbler. I'm the writer and producer of the story series.


Samantha: Why did you end the series?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: LD took over my series. He possessed the watcher and now everyone in Oakland is unsafe. Everyone in Oakland is going cookoo crazy and my series is dying. If only I could have some executive producer for my show.


Samantha: Why don't I help?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Writing a story takes tons of work. You'd need hundreds of bottles of green tea and you'd need powerful music to be a able to write the stories that I write. Are you sure you want to do this?


Samantha: Teach me the way of the story series. Train me.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Ok. *Gets a carpet. Sets up the carpet and grabs some green tea bottles. Place 2 next to me and 2 on the other side of the carpet.* Sit down and drink your tea. Close your eyes and think of ideas.


Samantha: Ok. *Drinks green tea and thinks.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Think about your idea and write. You are now trained in the art of Story Series.


Samantha: *Bows to Aaron* Thank you, Sensei Aaron.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: No prob. Now write the story with me! We are going to continue this series!


*Meanwhile in the story series world.*


Lord Conner (LD): HAHAHA! YOU FOOLS! I NOW RULE OAKLAND! YOU CAN'T STOP ME! SURRENDER TO ME! YOUR PRECIOUS WATCHER IS GONE… I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REALLY THOUGHT THE WATCHER BRAINWASHED YOU! BY KILLING HIM, YOU DESTROYED THIS BORDER AND NOW, I CAN FINALLY KILL EVERYONE IN THE WORLD- *Cage appears and locks Lord Conner in. The watcher comes out of the ground and is angry at LD.*


The Watcher : Haha! I am revived! Thanks Aaron!


Aaron (Story series version): No prob!


The watcher : NOBODY ENSLAVES MY PEOPLE! *Rebuilds the border and rebuilds the buildings. Rebuilds everything. Restores Oakland and its compassionate people. Revives Orbis and all the Oakland laws. Puts Red back in Cincinnati and turns Lord Conner into a child. Puts Lord Conner in a maximum security mental health hospital. Removes all the evilness and replaces it with good in every evil character. Revives everything magic. Restores Oakland completely. Restores the USB and magic book. Restores Elese and all the older characters. Removes the glitches and bugs. Revives everything good and fixes everything.* Oakland is restored! Now my people, Have fun again and don't fall for Lord Conner's brainwashings. I never brainwashed anyone. Now go on, Have some fun all my children who are all children! You will no longer be hurt and its thanks to God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit and for Aaron. Thank you very much and goodnight, Oakland!


*It is now night in Oakland and all the children go to sleep.*


The watcher : *Watches over my mighty town. The protection of God is over this town.* Ah, What a great day. I'll go take care of Red later…


*We now go back to the other universe with Kyle and his friends and family.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: We did it! We saved Oakland! Now there can be a 5th generation of the story series! Thank you, Samantha! To show you my gratitude, I will make you a portal to Oakland where you shall live and be happy with all your friends and family. You shall be a child and live in peace and harmony. Now go, Have fun in Oakland. But just note, It's night time there so be very quiet! Okay?


Samantha: Thanks for all your help!




*Samantha goes back to my house with Cecilia waiting there.*


Cecila: So, How'd it go?


Samantha: Pretty good!


Cecila: Can we go to Oakland?


Samantha: Yep! Just open the box and everyone will be in Oakland!


Cecila: Nice!


*Kyle hides under the bed.*


Samantha: The author will make us our own lab and it will be combined with Sophie's lab and Elese's lab to make one big lab! We just open the gift and we'll be teleported to Oakland. Just know it's night so we gotta be quiet.


Cecila: Oh, Ok!


*Samantha opens the box and the box does exactly what Samantha says.*


*Samantha is now in her own lab.*


*Kyle is hiding under a bed.*


*Sophie is in her lab and she notices a new lab. She opens the lab door and sees Samantha.*


Sophie : Hey new neighbors! 


Samantha: Hi there!


*Kyle notices Sophie and passes out.*


Cecila: Hello. I'm Cecila and this is Samantha,


Samantha: Hiiiii!


Cecila: And Kyle who is hiding under the bed.


Sophie : Oh! He's just like Troy! Maybe in the morning, Those two kids can play.


Cecila: Certainly!


Sophie : Well, Imma hit the hay, We can fully meet each other tomorrow.


Cecila: Okay. Nighty night.


*Sophie Goes to her room and sleeps.*


Samantha: Alright Cecila, Goodnight.


Cecila: Night. *Turns off the lights.*


*Cecila goes to sleep.*


*Kyle sneaks out of the lab door and goes to Sophie's lab.*


*Troy sneaks out of his room and notices Kyle. Kyle notices Troy.*


Troy: Hi.


Kyle: Hi.


Kyle: What's your name?


Troy: Troy. What's yours?


Kyle: Kyle.


Troy: Did your sister torment you?


Kyle: Mhm.


Troy: Same.


*A magic hand is holding a flashlight. It hears a noise so it goes out of Sophie's room and goes down to the kitchen. The hand notices Kyle and Troy awake and the hand gets a Strawberry milk bottle.*


Troy: RUN!


Kyle: WHAT IS THAT THING?


Troy: It's Sophie's magic hands. They are making sure we have a good sleep and they make sure we are healthy. The hands think that we freak out that we are not healthy and happy do they feed us strawberry milk so we don't cry. They are really good but they kinda scare me. The hands are playing with us right now so we should probably run. You don't want the hands to make you laugh. Once they play, They make sure you are happy. I'm okay with it but i don't like it when the hands pet my head because it makes me cry but i love it when I am fed strawberry milk and healed.


Kyle: AH! I DON'T LIKE IT!


Troy: I'll protect you. *Hugs and holds onto Kyle gently. Making sure magic hands don't make Kyle scared.*


*The magic hand tries to touch Kyle.*


Troy: NO. MAGIC HAND, NO. KYLE IS NEW TO THIS. HE IS ACTUALLY SCARED OF YOU. PLEASE DON'T PLAY WITH HIM.


*The magic hand does a thumbs up and makes a special bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle and makes a normal strawberry milk bottle for Troy. The magic hand feeds the strawberry milk bottle to Troy and Troy grabs the bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle.*


Troy: I can feed the bottle to Kyle.


*The magic hand goes to the back of the room and watches.*


Troy: The magic hand is not near us anymore. Let me feed the strawberry milk to you and we'll cuddle and sleep next to each other. I'll protect you.


Kyle: Okie. 


*Kyle drinks the Strawberry milk and falls asleep. Troy also falls asleep and holds onto Kyle and hugs him. Kyle coos and Troy coos. The magic hand cleans up the magic strawberry milk bottle mess and puts a blanket over Troy and Kyle. The hand pars Troy and goes upstairs to the magic hands room and goes to sleep next to the other magic hands.*


*The next morning.*


Sophie : *Goes to the kitchen with the magic hands.* Aww! It looks like Kyle and Troy got along! Come on magic hands, Go eat your magic strawberry milk dust. I'm going to wake up Kyle and Troy.


Sophie : *Takes the blanket off Troy. Begins to hug Troy.*


Troy: *Wakes up and smiles* Hey Sophie!


Sophie : Hey Troy! Did you have a good sleep?


Troy: Yeah!


*Sophie is about to playfully wake up Kyle as well.*


Troy: Sophie. Remember the kid that became depressed when you played with him? You know how he hated it when you played with him?


Sophie : Yeah?


Troy: Do you want Kyle to have a heart attack? Kyle doesn't like being playfully waken up and he doesn't like playful people so please, Let me wake him up.


Sophie : Sorry. I didn't know that Kyle wasn't a playful kid. I'll let you wake him up.


*Troy hugs and holds and cuddles Kyle and wakes Kyle up.*


Kyle: *Wakes up and hugs Troy. Cries from a nightmare.*


Troy: *Feeds Strawberry milk to Kyle.* Shh, Shh. It's okay. What's wrong?


Kyle: Nightmare.


Troy: The nightmare is gone. I'm here for you.


Kyle: *Feels better.* Thankie!


Troy: No probbie!


*While Sophie and the others are carrying on their day, Let's see the magic hands morning routine!




*Morning routine.*


*The magic hands wake up and tickle Sophie. They playfully help her get ready and the magic hands go to the magic forest. They begin chasing each other and playing. An enemy approaches. Oh no! It's the evil magic hands! The magic hands fight the evil magic hands. The magic hands win and the evil magic hands become good magic hands and join Sophie's magic hand army. The magic hands go back to the lab and spend some time with the people in the lab then they spread all throughout Oakland and make others happy.*


*That is what the magic hands do everyday.*


*Back to Sophie. We now rejoin Sophie going to meet some of her old friends.*


Sophie : Hey guys! I missed you!


*Sophie takes her friends to the lab and she makes a room for them.*


*End of story. Story Series 5 coming soon.*

A month has passed since Troy's death…


Sophie: I really miss troy…


She builds some sort of resurrection machine and is somehow able to revive Troy, only now he has no memories of anything or anyone in Oakland.

Sophie: Red? What are you doing here? I thought you moved out of Ohio?


Red: I did but I sensed that Troy was still alive.


Sophie: Yes, Yes. Troy is alive but he has no memories of anything. For some reason, Troy still looks like he's 13 even though he's 20.

*Sophie wakes up in her room and panics. She looks around and calms down. Sophie sees Troy sleeping in the corner with a bottle of Strawberry milk in his hands.*


Sophie: So Troy never died? Oh wow. What a crazy dream. What time is it? *Looks at my watch.* Oh. It's only 7 am. I'm going to get up and wake Troy up.


*Sophie gets up and drinks some wake up Strawberry milk. Sophie then gives Troy some wake up Strawberry milk and Troy wakes up.*

*We now go to Romone and Red.*

Red: What is it?


Romone: Uhh. Something SUSSY is going on in the lab and I need help.


Red: Ok.


*Romone takes Red to the lab.*


Red: So what's going on?


Romone: Look at Sophie.


Red: Uh. Why is there a dog that is being treated like a Troy?


Romone: Um. I don't know.


Red: Well I'm going to stop it.


Red: *Goes to Sophie.*


Sophie: Hi Red! What are you and Romone doing here?


Romone: What are you doing to that poor dog?


Sophie: I'm just treating it like I treat Troy!


Romone: Let go of the dog.


Sophie: NO.


Red: *Grabs Petie from Sophie and takes the pacifier and strawberry milk bottle out of the dog's mouth.*


*The dog starts crying like a Troy.*


Petie: WOOOOOOOOOOF!


Red: What… Did you do to the dog?


Romone: She turned it into a Troy.


Sophie: Give me the dog back!


Romone: No. I'm going to take care of Petite since you can't do it.


Sophie: The dog is gonna die from sugar if he lives with you!


Romone: I have special candy for dogs. He'll be completely fine.


Sophie: Then if I can't have a pet then… I'm going to turn everyone into a Troy…


*Sophie kicks Red and Romone out of her lab and she locks the door. Sophie sees Tick and Troy eating. Sophie looks at Tick with delight.*


Sophie: Hehehe. *Sneaks behind Tick and waits for him to finish eating. Then I snatch Tick.*


Troy: Sophie, What are you doing to Tick?


Sophie: Tick is gonna be my pet!


Troy: Oh no no no! You've already done this.


Sophie: IF I CAN'T TURN ANYONE INTO A PET, THEN I'M GOING TO MAKE EVERYONE A CHILD FOREVER. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO AGE AND YOU'LL ALL BE FED STRAWBERRY MILK. YOU'LL ALL BE MY PETS! MUHAHAHA!


*Sophie Goes to Orbis's palace and she tries to beat up Orbis but Orbis turns Sophie into a permanent child.*
 
Sophie: HEY! WHAT THE HECK?


Orbis: You never learn, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO KILL YOU AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE!


Orbis: No you ain't. I'm much stronger than you. I'm the second strongest entity in this town. If you kill me then you kill everyone in this world. I'm not letting you destroy this town with your evil ways, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO KILL Y-


Orbis: Shut up. *puts Sophie to sleep.*


Sophie: N- 


Orbis: That takes care of that.


*Orbis goes to the lab and sees what's going on.*


Orbis: Hey. Um. I don't know why Sophie is going crazy again but uh. I guess I'm going to take over this lab since Sophie is crazy and she is mentally unstable.


Tick: No more being called Tucky?


Orbis: No. You are still Tucky.


Tick: You should know I hate being called Tucky.


Orbis: It's funny.


Tick: GRRRR. MY NAME IS NOT TUCKY!


Orbis: Alright I'll note to call you Tucky.


Tick: I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU!


Orbis: Go ahead and see what happens.


*Tick tries to punch Orbis but he ends up going right through Orbis.*

Tick: STAND STILL!


Orbis: *Teleports behind Tick.* You are funny. I like annoying you.


*After Orbis annoys Tick for 10 minutes.*


Orbis: Ok guys. What do you kids want to eat?


Troy: Strawberry milk!


Orbis: No. You can't eat that!


Troy: I want it! Give me Strawberry milk!


Orbis: Ok. If that's what you want then ok. *Makes Troy a bottle of Strawberry milk.* There you go.


*Troy drinks the strawberry milk and starts to cry and scream.*


Orbis: Troy, Go to your room.


Troy: Ok! *Goes to me and Sam's room.*


Orbis: Ok Tick. What do you want to eat?


Tick (Pissed off): I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO I WANT? *Stares at Orbis' eyes.*


Orbis: I'm guessing you are still mad at me. I'm just gonna make you some Mac n cheese.*


Tick: *Gasps* MAC AND CHEESE? YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!


Orbis: Why does everyone just scream in my town? This town makes no sense.


Red: I know.


Orbis: Oh. Hi Red. I don't know how I didn't notice you. Anyways, Back to cooking!


*Orbis makes some Mac and cheese for Tick.*


Orbis: Here you go. 


Tick: *Wolfs down the entire batch of Mac and cheese.* Thanks. *Runs back to my room with my Nintendo switch.*


Orbis: Now Luke, What do you want to eat?


Luke: I am not hungry.


Orbis: I can see through your stomach. You are hungry. Now eat.


Luke: Wait. What now?


Orbis: I can see through your stomach.


Luke: NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Orbis: No I'm not getting away from you. You need to eat. Now don't act like a Troy now…


Luke: Don't act like a Troy? Don't you call me a Troy!


Orbis: I can call you whatever you want.


Luke: Oh really? Wanna fight?


Orbis: I don't fight my fellow citizens.


Luke: FIGHT ME.


Orbis: No. 


Luke: BEAT ME.


Orbis: No.


*Red looks at Luke*


Red: You remind me of Troy except you don't spray Strawberry milk on me and run around my pizzeria.


Luke: *Starts to throw a temper tantrum.*


Orbis: Stop it Luke. Don't make me do it…


*Luke doesn't stop.*


*Luke screams as Orbis scares Luke off.*


*Luke runs out of Ohio and runs to Louisiana. Red takes him there.*


Luke: Thanks Red.


*Red flies back to ohio.*


Luke: *I am angry at everyone.*


Young Aaron: IN LOUISIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA!


Luke: GRRR. SHUT UP. YOU ARE ANNOYING ME.


Young Aaron: Waaw! Why ywou mwean?


Luke: Sorry. I'm just angry at people.


Young Aaron: Oh. Iwt owk.


There is a strange force that flings Luke back. When he gets up young Aaron is nowhere to be found.


One week later…


Oakland has been pretty boring ever since Sophie disappeared and orbis took over.


*Luke wakes up in the enchanted magic forest and sees magic hands surrounding him.*


Luke: NO. I CAN'T BE HERE! AHHHHH! *Runs to Red's pizza.*


Luke: RED. I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE!


*Red answers the door.*


Red: How did you get back here from Louisiana?


Luke: I DON'T KNOW BUT I NEED HELP DESTROYING OAKLAND BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! I CAN'T TAKE THIS CONSTANT REPETITIVE LIFE. PLEASE STOP THIS TORTURE!


Red: You want to destroy Oakland and get rid of the magic and weirdness?


Luke: YES. PLEASE END THIS NEVER ENDING TORTURE!


Red: Ok. I'll help. But we need to come up with a plan…


*Epic plan making montage.*


Luke: Alright. Explain the plan to me again?


Red: Ok so we need to get rid of Orbis and Oakland's power. Since you are good at hacking you can distract Orbis while I kill him and destroy his power of Oakland.


Luke: Ok. Let's do this.


*We now enter Red's pov*


Red: *Goes to Orbis's palace and sneaks in.*


*Orbis is watching Young Aaron.*


*Orbis doesn't notice Red.*


*Red snaps Orbis's neck and eats Orbis. Red then nukes Orbis's palace and powerplant.*


*Luke runs away from the explosion and meets Red at Soapbar's palace.*


Luke: I guess this is goodbye. Nah. JUST BLOW EVERYTHING UP!


Red: If you say so. Get on my back. I'll fly to safety.


Luke: K.


*Red flies Luke to safety. Luke watches Oakland get destroyed. Kurtis and Cleetus are with Luke. Romone and the Romanians+ King Aaron are also with Luke.*


*Red blows up Oakland.*


*A weird phenomenon happens where it seems that oakland reverts back to normal in a blink of an eye. It seems that there is something that prevents Oakland's destruction, but what could it be? Everyone is suddenly teleported back to Oakland and some strange border forms around the city. Everyone blacks out and their memories of this day happening were wiped. They all wake up back to where they were originally.* 
Luke: *wakes up* huh.. What a weird dream. Wait a second… THAT WAS REAL! SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BRAINWASH ME! 


*Luke goes to Red's.*


Luke: RED! I NEED YOUR HELP! 


Red: I know. Oakland got resetted again.


Luke: HOW ARE YOU NOT AFFECTED?


Red: I'm a robot. I can't be affected by Oakland.


Luke: WHY DOESN'T THIS NIGHTMARE END???


Red: The only way to end this is to find the source…


Luke: Hmm. Maybe we can catch the thing that resets Oakland.


Red: And since the technology can't be affected, Maybe we could record the reset and see what is causing this.


Luke: Wow. That's actually not a bad idea!


Red: I've seen this happen many times… Where is Cleetus and the others?


Luke: Well, I don't know. Last time I saw them was when we were out of Oakland.


Red: So it seems like something is watching whatever the people do… Almost like a TV show where the director watches everything.


Luke: But this isn't a show. This is reality.


Red: We need to focus on the plan. Let's stop breaking the 4th wall.


Luke: K. So let's get a camera and you record the action since you can't be affected.


*Red gets a camera from somewhere and records Oakland.*


*Luke walks out of the border of Oakland and Oakland resets. Red caught the action on tape.*


Red: I got the recording- Oh right. Everytime Oakland resets, Every living thing is teleported back to the lab and/or their house.


*Luke runs out the lab. Magic hands chase him.*


Luke: RED! I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU. THE WATCHER. THAT'S THE GUY WHO IS CONTROLLING THIS. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS- IT'S UP TO YOU TO SAVE THE WORLD. 


*The magic hands take Luke back to the lab and they treat him like a baby.*


Red: It's up to me, huh?


*Cleetus is heard screaming*


Red: Cleetus? Alright, Watcher. Reveal yourself to me. I want to have a chat.


*The watcher appears.*


The watcher : Hello there. My name is Kyle owner of Oakland. You can call me Kai. I see you have a question of how I run this town… AND THE WORLD!


Red: What have you done to Cleetus?


The Watcher: Oh nothing. 


Red: TELL ME.


The watcher : Let's just say he's all tied up.


Red: STOP THIS AT ONCE.


The Watcher : Oh little Reddie, Soon you'll be just like everyone else. A child.


Red: NO.


The Watcher : Oh? Wanna fight for Oakland now? I'm stronger than everyone in this town. I can easily defeat you…


Red: Let's Play a game….


The Watcher : What kind of game?


Red: Oh you'll see… *Epic fighting montage*
                          
*Red fights the watcher. Red is able to easily kill the watcher.*


*The watcher is at 1% health*


Red: Now… Prepare to… DiEeEeEeEeEeEe…


*Red kills the watcher*


*The borders disappear. The magic hands let go of everyone.*


*Everyone is free to leave.*


*Luke leaves Oakland.*


Luke: I'M FREEEEEEEEEEE! 


*All the ghost people rise from the grave and start chasing Troy out of Oakland.*


*Troy is officially in a new town. Luke is in a new town. Red stays in Oakland with Cleetus. All seems well.*




















*The watcher comes back to life.*


The watcher : Hahaha… that was my clone! You really think you could defeat me?


*The watcher brings everyone back to Oakland and puts the border back over Oakland.*


Luke: GRRRRRRRRRRRR! 


The Watcher : Sorry Red but… *Kicks Red out of Oakland and puts a metal forcefield over Oakland.*


Luke: AHHHHH! WE ARE ALL HOPELESS! EVERYONE, RUN!!!!!


*Troy drinks his Strawberry milk and looks at the watcher. He just stares at the watcher.*


The watcher : Hello Troy! What are you doing? 


Troy: Drinking my Strawberry milk!


The watcher : Well what if I gave you an unlimited supply of this stuff? All you gotta do is convince your friends to drink it and make sure to do what the magic hands do then you can have all the Strawberry milk you want!


Troy: So I just do what I do to Sam but i do it to everyone?


The watcher : Yes.


Troy: Okie! *I notice Luke and I run up to him.*


Troy: *Grabs Luke and force feeds him Strawberry milk then hugs him.* Hey Lukie!


Luke: *Tries to force Troy off of me but Troy doesn't stop. Starts to become sleepy and starts to become like Troy.* 


Troy: Aww! Now onto my other fwiends!


*Troy turns everyone into a Troy and the watcher puts hypnosis helmets on everyone.*


The watcher : Repeat after me. I will not be evil. I will do what the watcher tells me to do.


*Meanwhile with Red.*


Red: *Tries to get in.* WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE PEOPLE IN THERE?


*Red sees everyone brainwashed.*


Red: What the- What the heck is happening?


The watcher : *Teleports Red into Oakland.* I'm glad you asked! I just made everyone like Troy!


Red: YOU BRAINWASHED AND HYPNOTIZED THESE… KIDS?


The watcher : I'm only protecting them…


Red: STOP BRAINWASHING THEM!


*To be continued…*


Narrator: Welcome to the newest Story Series episode.


Let's begin.


*In Oakland, There lives one boy who goes by the name of Duke. Duke was a child just like everyone else in Oakland but Duke had one fear. Angels! Everytime Duke saw a angel, Duke would scream and panic kinda like Troy except Duke was fearful of Angels only. Let's see how our story goes.*


*Let's begin.*


Duke: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Sees my pa.*


Duke: Hi Pa. 


Duke's pa: Howdy, Duke! 


*Duke eats breakfast.*


Duke: I'm going to see Orbis. Is that ok?


Duke's pa: Yeah. I don't mind.


*Duke goes to Orbis.*


Duke's pa: Now I'm alone…


Ghost : No you aren't! 


Duke's pa: AH- Oh. Hello.


Ghost: My name is Trista!


Duke's pa: You are such a cute ghost! Wanna go move to the Bahamas and spend some time together?


Ghost: What about the kid?


Duke's pa: Sophie can take care of him.


Ghost: Works for me!


*Duke's pa and the ghost move to the Bahamas.*


*Meanwhile with Duke.*


*Duke is now at Orbis's palace.*


Duke: Hey Orbis. 


Orbis: Hello Duke. What can I do for you?


Duke: Can I have a tour of Soapbar's lab?


Orbis: Yes you can. Is your dad around?


Duke: He left me for a ghost.


Orbis: Oh! So sad! Let me take you to Elese and she'll take care of you.


Duke: Okay!


*Orbis walks Duke to Elese's lab.*


*Orbis knocks on Elese's door to her lab.*


*Elese answers the door.*


Orbis: Hello Elese! This is a kid without a parent called Duke.


Elese: Aww! He's so cute! I think he'll be perfect here.


Orbis: Alright. Well, I'm going back to my place, Take care of Elese for me!


Elese: Ok!


Orbis: *Goes back to my place.*


Elese: Come on in, Duke!


*Duke comes in his house.*


Elese: Do you need anything, Duke?


Duke: No.


Elese: You look a bit tired, Duke. Are you okay?


Duke: Yeah. I haven't really slept much.


Elese: Why can't you sleep?


Duke: That is personal information I cannot disclose to you.


Elese: I understand. You don't have to tell me. I still do want you to sleep though.


Duke: But I don't want to sleep.


Elese: I have the perfect place for you to sleep.


Duke: Please not the basement..


Elese: NO! NEVER!  You are going to a comfortable sleeping room!


Duke: O-Okay. 


*Elese takes Duke to a bedroom with a child Duke's age sleeping. Elese puts Duke next to the child.*


Elese: Hug the child.


Duke: Why?


Elese: The child is sad and I think you'll feel good when you hug him. *Turns off the lights and tucks Duke in. Makes Duke hug the child gently and closes the bedroom door.*


Duke: *Falls asleep and starts to panic as I'm dreaming.*


*The other child wakes up and sees Duke hugging. The child feels better but the child sees Duke panicking so the other kid hugs Duke and goes back to sleep.*


Duke (Dreaming): AHH! WHERE AM I?


*The other kid appears in Duke's dream.*


Duke (Dreaming): SOMEBODY HELP ME!


*The other kid taps on Duke*


Kale (Other kid): Hey, You ok?


Duke: NO! I'M NOT OK! MY BIGGEST FEARS ARE ALL AROUND ME! PWEASE HELP ME!


*Kale hugs Duke gently*


Kale: Shhhh. You were the one who hugged me while I was asleep, Now I'm going to return the favor to you.


Duke: Please pwotect me…


Kale: *Continues hugging.* I will.


Duke: Thank you…


Kale: No problem.


*An angel flies over to Duke.*


Duke: *Screams*


*The angel tries to hug Duke.*


Duke: *Screams and wakes up.*


Kale: *Wakes up and looks at Duke.*


Duke: Hey.


Kale: I'm going to protect you.


Duke: Thank you. *Hugs and kisses kale.*


*Elese comes into the room .*


Elese: Hey Duke and Kale- AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! YOU TWO ARE SO ADORABLE!


Duke: I'm hungry!


Elese: Well, Let's eat!


Kale: What are we eating?


Elese: What do you cuties want to eat.


Kale: Idk. Surprise us.


Elese: Okay!


*Elese makes the food.*


*After she makes the food.*


Elese: Alright kids, Dig in! I made you cuties some breakfast!


*Duke and Kale eat*


*After they eat*


Kale: I’m full.


Duke: Me too.


Elese: Well kids, I was thinking that today we could go somewhere fun! I was thinking we could go to a different dimension!


Kale: Sounds fun!


Duke: I’m down.


Elese: Alright! Now if I could just find my portal gun then we could- *Sees my magic portal gun* Aha! Found it! *I open a portal to the wrong dimension and I try to close the portal. Duke gets sucked into the portal and the portal closes.*


Kale: Oh no! Duke got sucked into the portal! What do we do?


Elese: I think the portal gun is broken. I’m going to fix it then we need to open the portal. For now though, Just chill out.


*Meanwhile with Duke*


*Duke gets up. He is now in a dimension full of nice, gentle and friendly angels with powers! Duke won’t like that…*


*Duke looks around. Duke is terrified.*


*A angel flies down to Duke.*


Angey: Hello! My name is Angey! You must be a small human child! What’s your name, Child?


Duke: AHHHH! NO! MY NIGHTMARES ARE REAL!!!!! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Angey: Hey! Are you-


*Duke starts to cry.*


Angey: Woah! Please don’t cry! It’s ok! 


*All the angels see Duke crying and they fly over to Duke and hug him and play with him. The angels begin to comfort Duke and try to calm Duke down. Duke starts to turn red and Duke’s eyes go wide. The angels use their angel powers to do everything they can to help Duke but Duke is still mentally hurt.*


*One of the angels uses their mind healing powers to heal Duke’s mind. Duke starts to cry even more. The angels hug and cuddle Duke and they begin to cry with Duke. Duke realizes these angels are not a threat and Duke calms down. Duke is then introduced to angel city and the angels protect Duke. They teach Duke about their leader, God and how they praise him and worship him. The angels introduce Duke to worship music and the angels take care of Duke.*


*Meanwhile, Elese and Kale have fixed the portal gun and they go into the dimension. They enter into the angel dimension and the angels all welcome Kale and Elese. Duke runs to Kale and hugs him. The angels wave goodbye to Duke and the others and the angels resume their normal activity.*


*Duke has a good life*


*End of story*
Hey guys, Young Aaron here. Today we are going to be talking about how we can improve the Young Aaron personality. If you don't know what Young Aaron is, He is a young version of modern day Tick. Tick decided to revive his young self because he enjoys his younger self but he wants to change his younger self to be better. Young Aaron is the official mascot of the Tick YouTube channel and Tick has decided to make a series about it. By the way, The T.G.O.G series will continue. I am not ending it. I'm just thinking of new episode ideas. Now, Without further Ado, Let's begin today's Young Aaron research. This is the first time I am researching but I hope it goes well. So, Let's start our research.


Alright guys. So the first step to building a better Young me is to eliminate evil and replace it with good and nurture the kid with Compassion and kindness. That way, It'll make young Aaron less of an evil kid and more of a nicer kid! We also should eliminate bullying as bullying is not allowed on my channel. We also need to make sure Young Aaron's character is respectful, Kid-like and innocent but not hurtful or mean to others. We need to make sure Young Aaron can help others be Christian and that is do what I plan to do. I plan to make everyone better persons and Christians. Now that we got all the big important info out of the way, Let's talk about what videos I will be making! So I will be making some very respectful videos that teach people lessons. I will also be making some narrations, I'll be doing many different things just like Tick! I'll also be helping you guys out AND I'LL BE DOING LIVE STREAMS! IT'LL BE SO FUN! My streams will be very different from Tick's streams though. So, What other things will I be talking about in this research? Nothing. I've run out of ideas for this research. (WHY DO I PLAY AMERICAN IDOL? I DON'T WAAAAAANA PLAY IT ANYMORE DO LET'S HIDE IN THE OLD DAYS AND PLAY AMERICAN IDOL WHILE DRINKING A CUP OF GREEN TEA. This will be spoken in a very dramatic and deep funny voice.)

I  PRESENT  TO YOU the one the only made by me
IN THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By: AARON
What people need to know is that i think i could spend time with my friends in the future because they care about me. for exzample i went a abanded arcade place that has animatronics that still work, also i enjoy playing the arcade there, my friends are also nice to me, and we have fun exploring i went to the ambaned pizza place for exzample they have a old maskout chuck e cheese, and the animatronic band is 101 lbs. I had to call a tow truck that could lift it. I will have to call the tow truck tommrow.
Since the animatronics are still at the pizza place i maby[c] i could haul the animatronics to my house. But the problem is i can`t haul the animatronic band in my mom`s car. So i will have to call a tow truck to tow today it can just pick up the broken parts and tow it to my house. I have solved the problem. So if you ever want a animatronic band just go to a abanded pizza place that has animatronics that still work un plug the animatronic, then call a tow truck, finley wait till the tow truck comes to your house then you will have a animatronic band.  I hope you enjoyed my document bye bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So one day at reds redthebear was hm….. Let's see here i think he was… oh i remember! He was kissing roxy. Also another day at romones he was feeding clammy but than clammy broke the wall of jawbreaker. So meanwhile at reds, red was still kissing roxy when suddenly the phone rang. Red answered it and romone said something. “Hey red how ya do- but… this is not what the story is about… this is about the war of video games... all of the video games in the universe went into war…… so another day at reds red was panicking because of the war and he was smashing the walls and tipping over the ball pit and all of the balls slid down stairs and scattered all over the place “red why are you going crazy?” “OMG CAN'T YOU SEE? THERE IS A WAR OUT THERE!!!” so meanwhile in romones clammy could not stop eating romone and romone accidentally killed clammy and killed lamone in his romone pack “ romone, you gotta stop doing this!!!! You're trashing the palace and we have a low amount of survivors because of you!!!!” “ WELL TO BAD YOU GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF DUMB AND STUPID CANDY WEAKLINGS!!!!!!” meanwhile at reds again red has calmed down and apologised and now he is fixing the walls and ball pit. “ hey red i know it is rough out there and i know it made you panic.” “ well i was thinking... remember that time when i stopped that nuke?

“The time I lied and regretted it...”
One exhausting summer day, Me, My mom Tatra, My sister Toti
and my sister’s friend Margy all met up and went to the park. My
mom Tatra said, “Now I am going to go for a walk with Margy’s
mom. Here are the rules... Rule 1. Don’t rough house or
anything. Rule 2. Do not leave the park unless we say you guys
can. Rule 3. Don’t go in the woods. Got it?” Then I said, “Yes
Mom. We got it.” Toti also said “Yes, we got it. We’ll follow the
rules...” Tatra, my mom said “Ok. Now you kids go do whatever
you kids do these days.” I said “Ok.” Then me and Toti went to
swing on the swings. 30 minutes later I decided to go see what
Margy was doing and Margy was on her cell phone googling
random things. A few minutes later, Margy decided to come to
us and she said this “ Hey guys. Wanna play tag?” I said sure.
Toti said “sure why not?” So we played tag for 1 hour and after
playing tag, Margy went to her original location and went on her
phone. Then Margy got off her cell phone and went to us, and
she asked both of us “Hey guys! Do you want to break a rule that
we aren’t supposed to break?” I said “Um. I don’t mean to be a
party pooper but... Don’t you think that is a bad idea? We might
get in trouble!” Margy said “Oh shut up! We won’t get caught if
we don’t tell them!” My sister Toti said “I’m down!” Margy said
“Come on Aaron! Let’s go to the woods! I promise they won’t find
out!” So I said “Ok as long as they don’t find out...” Oh but boy
was I wrong! So we went far into the woods that Tatra specifically
told us not to go into. Then after 40 minutes of playing in the
woods, We came out and Margy said “See? I told you our moms
won’t find out!” Tatra knew we were in the woods all along and
came up to us and said “Were you guys in those woods? I
thought I heard you guys there...” Margy said “this was all
Aaron’s idea! I had nothing to do with it!” Tatra said “You are in a
lot of trouble mister!” Then Margy’s mom took Margy home and
Tatra took us home. As soon as I came in the door of my house
Tatra said “I can’t believe you two would go in the woods! For
breaking my rules you both are grounded for one month!” I said “But Mom! I- I- I didn’t do it! It was Margy! Please! BELIEVE
ME!!!!” Tatra said “I have heard enough YOU ARE
GROUNDED!!!!” As I went into my room, I planned to prove my
innocence. So I came up with a plan. One month later when I got
ungrounded, We went to the park again but this time i got my
phone. So Margy went into the woods and she started bragging
about how she wasn’t going to be in trouble and that I was. The
whole time she said that, I was recording her. So after she
stopped bragging she said “What are you doing?” I said “Um...
Nothing?” I ran to Tatra and explained to her what happened, and
I showed Margy’s mom the video. Margy ran up to my mom and
said “Mrs. Tatra! It wasn’t me! I was framed!”
Her mom came up to her and said “It wasn’t you? Then why does
that video show proof? Are you lying?” Margy said “No! I was
framed!” Margy’s mom said “YOU FRAMED AARON!!! When we
get home you are in a lot of trouble Missy...”
Margy’s mom dragged Margy home.
Margy got grounded. My mom said “I’m sorry for blaming you...
you are a good kid and you’d never do this.” I said “It’s ok mom. I
understand. Margy’s mom called Tatra and apologized. Margy
got disciplined. Margy never went into those woods again.

*There was a boy who was 13. There was also a girl who was 10. These two kids lived together. The boy would always get teased by the girl. One day, The boy became silent. He would avoid the girl completely. The boy was named Kyle and the girl was named Cecilia. Let's see what happens next!


*Present day*


Cecila: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Tries to find Kyle. I can't find him. I notice a note at the front door. It's from Kyle.* A note? Not again… Probably ANOTHER STUPID NOTE ABOUT WORK OR HOW HE'S "Sorry"... WHAT A PATHETIC DISGUSTING BROTHER I HAVE.


*The note reads "Hello, Ceceila. If you are reading this, Well, I'm leaving. I'm going to do what you told me to do! Jump off a bridge and die! I'm going to never be around you again. I'm going to leave. You'll never see me again. Goodbye forever."*


Cecila : I don't give a crap if he's dead!


*Meanwhile with Kyle.*


Kyle: Well, Time to die…


*Someone notices Kyle about to jump. The person grabs Kyle and hugs him.*


Samantha: Sir, Please tell me, Why did you want to jump?


Kyle: My family doesn't care about me.


Samantha: But you are so young! You have so much to learn.


Kyle: Nobody gives a care about me.


Samantha: Well I "give a" care about you.


Kyle: Really?


Samantha: Yeah. How about I take you to my house? It's pretty close by to where we are!


Kyle: O-Okay.


*Samantha takes Kyle to his house.*

Kyle: WE ARE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD! Are you my neighbor?


Samantha: I guess so?


Kyle: My family lives here…


Samantha: Don't worry. I'll protect you from your family.


Kyle: Thank you.


*A few days later.*


Kyle: Hey Samantha?


Samantha: Yeah?


Kyle: You know that one show called the story series?


Samantha: Mhm, What about it?


Kyle: Can we try to revive it?


Samantha: Well I happen to know the creator so yeah! 


Kyle: Ok!


*Meanwhile with Cecilia*


Cecila : I miss mom and dad… Now that Kyle is gone… I can't talk to anyone… I didn't mean to hurt him! I thought I was joking with him! Well, It's too late for me to apologize to Kyle since he's dead. *Cries* I miss Kyle!


*Cecila pulls herself together.*


Cecila : Maybe I'll go on a walk. That'll clear my head!


*Cecila walks out of her house. She decides to see what her neighbor is up to. Cecila knocks on the neighbor's door.*


Samantha: *Hears the knock.* Oh! I'll get it!


*Samantha answers the door. Kyle sees Cecilia and hides under his bed.*


Samantha: Hi! How can I help you, Neighbor?


Cecila : I want to talk about something…


Samantha: Have you been crying?


Cecila : Yeah. I miss my family…


Samantha: Come on in. I'll make you some Strawberry milk. Maybe my friend can cheer you up or something.


Cecila : That'd be nice.


*Cecila comes in Samantha's house and makes herself comfy.*


Samantha: I'll get you some Strawberry milk.


Cecila : Ok.


*Cecila looks around.* I really miss mom and dad…

Samantha: *Brings Cecilia into the guest bedroom.* He should be in here somewhere- *Sees Kyle under the bed and drags him out from under the bed.*


Kyle: *Tries to hold on but is lifted up and revealed to Cecilia.*


Cecila : It really is him… I thought he died!


Samantha: Huh? What do you mean?


*Kyle runs out the room.*


Cecila : Great. He ran out of the room. Well, That Kyle is my brother.


Samantha: He told me some things about you…


Cecila : I know. I've been awful to him but I decided to become nicer and I wanted to apologize to him.


Samantha: That's good. Maybe you can invite him for dinner at your house?


Cecila : He'll just run off when he sees me.


Samantha: Oh. Maybe I can keep him still?


Cecila: He'll be scarred for life if he sees me. He'll think we're bullying him.

Cecila : I don't think he likes this…


Samantha: This clearly isn't working. *Lets Kyle free.*


Kyle: *Runs off. Goes under my bed.*


Cecila : I think I may have one other solution to our problem.


Kyle: What is it?


Cecila : There was this old show that Kyle used to watch called The Story Series. It ended a week ago. Maybe if we revive it then we can get some answers from the characters on what to do.


Samantha: Ok. *Turns on a TV* No way… It says here that somebody already revived the story series! I think I have a idea. Ok so hear me out. If we can replicate Sophie's magic staff, Then we could travel to Oakland through a portal and have Sophie fix Kyle, and thus, We'd be featured on a Story Series show!


Cecila : But the author clearly says that it ended!
Samantha: Let's go pay the author a visit…


*Samantha goes to Aaron's house.*


Samantha: Excuse me, Is this where the author of the story series lives?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Why yes it is! The name's Aaron. Aaron. J. Hebbler. I'm the writer and producer of the story series.


Samantha: Why did you end the series?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: LD took over my series. He possessed the watcher and now everyone in Oakland is unsafe. Everyone in Oakland is going cookoo crazy and my series is dying. If only I could have some executive producer for my show.


Samantha: Why don't I help?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Writing a story takes tons of work. You'd need hundreds of bottles of green tea and you'd need powerful music to be a able to write the stories that I write. Are you sure you want to do this?


Samantha: Teach me the way of the story series. Train me.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Ok. *Gets a carpet. Sets up the carpet and grabs some green tea bottles. Place 2 next to me and 2 on the other side of the carpet.* Sit down and drink your tea. Close your eyes and think of ideas.


Samantha: Ok. *Drinks green tea and thinks.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Think about your idea and write. You are now trained in the art of Story Series.


Samantha: *Bows to Aaron* Thank you, Sensei Aaron.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: No prob. Now write the story with me! We are going to continue this series!


*Meanwhile in the story series world.*


Lord Conner (LD): HAHAHA! YOU FOOLS! I NOW RULE OAKLAND! YOU CAN'T STOP ME! SURRENDER TO ME! YOUR PRECIOUS WATCHER IS GONE… I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REALLY THOUGHT THE WATCHER BRAINWASHED YOU! BY KILLING HIM, YOU DESTROYED THIS BORDER AND NOW, I CAN FINALLY KILL EVERYONE IN THE WORLD- *Cage appears and locks Lord Conner in. The watcher comes out of the ground and is angry at LD.*


The Watcher : Haha! I am revived! Thanks Aaron!


Aaron (Story series version): No prob!


The watcher : NOBODY ENSLAVES MY PEOPLE! *Rebuilds the border and rebuilds the buildings. Rebuilds everything. Restores Oakland and its compassionate people. Revives Orbis and all the Oakland laws. Puts Red back in Cincinnati and turns Lord Conner into a child. Puts Lord Conner in a maximum security mental health hospital. Removes all the evilness and replaces it with good in every evil character. Revives everything magic. Restores Oakland completely. Restores the USB and magic book. Restores Elese and all the older characters. Removes the glitches and bugs. Revives everything good and fixes everything.* Oakland is restored! Now my people, Have fun again and don't fall for Lord Conner's brainwashings. I never brainwashed anyone. Now go on, Have some fun all my children who are all children! You will no longer be hurt and its thanks to God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit and for Aaron. Thank you very much and goodnight, Oakland!


*It is now night in Oakland and all the children go to sleep.*


The watcher : *Watches over my mighty town. The protection of God is over this town.* Ah, What a great day. I'll go take care of Red later…


*We now go back to the other universe with Kyle and his friends and family.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: We did it! We saved Oakland! Now there can be a 5th generation of the story series! Thank you, Samantha! To show you my gratitude, I will make you a portal to Oakland where you shall live and be happy with all your friends and family. You shall be a child and live in peace and harmony. Now go, Have fun in Oakland. But just note, It's night time there so be very quiet! Okay?


Samantha: Thanks for all your help!




*Samantha goes back to my house with Cecilia waiting there.*


Cecila: So, How'd it go?


Samantha: Pretty good!


Cecila: Can we go to Oakland?


Samantha: Yep! Just open the box and everyone will be in Oakland!


Cecila: Nice!


*Kyle hides under the bed.*


Samantha: The author will make us our own lab and it will be combined with Sophie's lab and Elese's lab to make one big lab! We just open the gift and we'll be teleported to Oakland. Just know it's night so we gotta be quiet.


Cecila: Oh, Ok!


*Samantha opens the box and the box does exactly what Samantha says.*


*Samantha is now in her own lab.*


*Kyle is hiding under a bed.*


*Sophie is in her lab and she notices a new lab. She opens the lab door and sees Samantha.*


Sophie : Hey new neighbors! 


Samantha: Hi there!

Samantha: Hiiiii!


Cecila: And Kyle who is hiding under the bed.


Sophie : Oh! He's just like Troy! Maybe in the morning, Those two kids can play.


Cecila: Certainly!


Sophie : Well, Imma hit the hay, We can fully meet each other tomorrow.


Cecila: Okay. Nighty night.


*Sophie Goes to her room and sleeps.*


Samantha: Alright Cecila, Goodnight.


Cecila: Night. *Turns off the lights.*


*Cecila goes to sleep.*


*Kyle sneaks out of the lab door and goes to Sophie's lab.*


*Troy sneaks out of his room and notices Kyle. Kyle notices Troy.*


Troy: Hi.


Kyle: Hi.


Kyle: What's your name?


Troy: Troy. What's yours?


Kyle: Kyle.


Troy: Did your sister torment you?


Kyle: Mhm.


Troy: Same.


*A magic hand is holding a flashlight. It hears a noise so it goes out of Sophie's room and goes down to the kitchen. The hand notices Kyle and Troy awake and the hand gets a Strawberry milk bottle.*


Troy: RUN!


Kyle: WHAT IS THAT THING?


Troy: It's Sophie's magic hands. They are making sure we have a good sleep and they make sure we are healthy. The hands think that we freak out that we are not healthy and happy do they feed us strawberry milk so we don't cry. They are really good but they kinda scare me. The hands are playing with us right now so we should probably run. You don't want the hands to make you laugh. Once they play, They make sure you are happy. I'm okay with it but i don't like it when the hands pet my head because it makes me cry but i love it when I am fed strawberry milk and healed.


Kyle: AH! I DON'T LIKE IT!


Troy: I'll protect you. *Hugs and holds onto Kyle gently. Making sure magic hands don't make Kyle scared.*


*The magic hand tries to touch Kyle.*


Troy: NO. MAGIC HAND, NO. KYLE IS NEW TO THIS. HE IS ACTUALLY SCARED OF YOU. PLEASE DON'T PLAY WITH HIM.


*The magic hand does a thumbs up and makes a special bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle and makes a normal strawberry milk bottle for Troy. The magic hand feeds the strawberry milk bottle to Troy and Troy grabs the bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle.*


Troy: I can feed the bottle to Kyle.


*The magic hand goes to the back of the room and watches.*


Troy: The magic hand is not near us anymore. Let me feed the strawberry milk to you and we'll cuddle and sleep next to each other. I'll protect you.


Kyle: Okie. 


*Kyle drinks the Strawberry milk and falls asleep. Troy also falls asleep and holds onto Kyle and hugs him. Kyle coos and Troy coos. The magic hand cleans up the magic strawberry milk bottle mess and puts a blanket over Troy and Kyle. The hand pars Troy and goes upstairs to the magic hands room and goes to sleep next to the other magic hands.*


*The next morning.*


Sophie : *Goes to the kitchen with the magic hands.* Aww! It looks like Kyle and Troy got along! Come on magic hands, Go eat your magic strawberry milk dust. I'm going to wake up Kyle and Troy.


Sophie : *Takes the blanket off Troy. Begins to hug Troy.*


Troy: *Wakes up and smiles* Hey Sophie!


Sophie : Hey Troy! Did you have a good sleep?


Troy: Yeah!


*Sophie is about to playfully wake up Kyle as well.*


Troy: Sophie. Remember the kid that became depressed when you played with him? You know how he hated it when you played with him?


Sophie : Yeah?


Troy: Do you want Kyle to have a heart attack? Kyle doesn't like being playfully waken up and he doesn't like playful people so please, Let me wake him up.


Sophie : Sorry. I didn't know that Kyle wasn't a playful kid. I'll let you wake him up.


*Troy hugs and holds and cuddles Kyle and wakes Kyle up.*


Kyle: *Wakes up and hugs Troy. Cries from a nightmare.*


Troy: *Feeds Strawberry milk to Kyle.* Shh, Shh. It's okay. What's wrong?


Kyle: Nightmare.


Troy: The nightmare is gone. I'm here for you.


Kyle: *Feels better.* Thankie!


Troy: No probbie!


*While Sophie and the others are carrying on their day, Let's see the magic hands morning routine!




*Morning routine.*


*The magic hands wake up and tickle Sophie. They playfully help her get ready and the magic hands go to the magic forest. They begin chasing each other and playing. An enemy approaches. Oh no! It's the evil magic hands! The magic hands fight the evil magic hands. The magic hands win and the evil magic hands become good magic hands and join Sophie's magic hand army. The magic hands go back to the lab and spend some time with the people in the lab then they spread all throughout Oakland and make others happy.*


*That is what the magic hands do everyday.*


*Back to Sophie. We now rejoin Sophie going to meet some of her old friends.*


Sophie : Hey guys! I missed you!


*Sophie takes her friends to the lab and she makes a room for them.*


*End of story. Story Series 5 coming soon.*
Continuation of the last Troy story. 


A month has passed since Troy's death…


Sophie: I really miss troy…


She builds some sort of resurrection machine and is somehow able to revive Troy, only now he has no memories of anything or anyone in Oakland.


Troy: Where am i? Who are you? WHO AM I?


Sophie: Troy? Don't you remember me?


Troy: No. Who are you and who am I?


Sophie: DON'T YOU REMEMBER OAKLAND? THE MAGIC HANDS? THE STRAWBERRY MILK? DON'T YOU REMEMBER ALL THE ROBOTS?


Troy: No. What are you talking about? 


Sophie: Your name is Troy and you live in a magic world called Oakland!


Troy: My name is Troy? What do I do?


Sophie: Well, You like to cry and scream. You annoy everyone. You are scared of everything.


Troy: That sounds lame. I think I'd be more of a dog.


Sophie: YOU ARE NOT A DOG!


Troy: Woof woof. 


Mark: Does Troy have amnesia? 


Sophie: Yes. He thinks he's a dog.


Mark: Oh I know how to handle this. Ok Troy. So you are a dog and you are named Petie.


Troy: Yay! My name is Petie. So. What do I do?


Mark: You like pacifiers and drinking milk. You also like sleeping.


Troy: O.. Kay? I don't feel like I do that.


Mark: Trust me. You do.


Sophie: MARK! STOP PLAYING AROUND! TROY IS NOT A DOG! TROY ISN'T A PETIE. TELL TROY THE TRUTH.


*Red appears*


Sophie: Red? What are you doing here? I thought you moved out of Ohio?


Red: I did but I sensed that Troy was still alive.


Sophie: Yes, Yes. Troy is alive but he has no memories of anything. For some reason, Troy still looks like he's 13 even though he's 20.


Red: Probably because people look younger in this town.

Tick: No! Don't go in there! I'm warning you!


*Sophie opens the door of Tick's room and her eyes open wide. Sophie sees a room full of androids that are painted to look like certain characters.*


Sophie: WHAT THE HECK IS THIS? 


Tick: I may or may not have killed Troy a long time ago?


Sophie: This whole time I'VE BEEN WITH AN ANDROID? HOW LONG WAS TROY DEAD FOR?


Tick: 32 years.

Sophie: IS EVERYONE AN ANDROID? AHHHHHHHHH!




*Sophie wakes up in her room and panics. She looks around and calms down. Sophie sees Troy sleeping in the corner with a bottle of Strawberry milk in his hands.*

Romone: She turned it into a Troy.


Sophie: Give me the dog back!


Romone: No. I'm going to take care of Petite since you can't do it.


Sophie: The dog is gonna die from sugar if he lives with you!


Romone: I have special candy for dogs. He'll be completely fine.


Sophie: Then if I can't have a pet then… I'm going to turn everyone into a Troy…


*Sophie kicks Red and Romone out of her lab and she locks the door. Sophie sees Tick and Troy eating. Sophie looks at Tick with delight.*


Sophie: Hehehe. *Sneaks behind Tick and waits for him to finish eating. Then I snatch Tick.*


Troy: Sophie, What are you doing to Tick?


Sophie: Tick is gonna be my pet!

Sophie: IF I CAN'T TURN ANYONE INTO A PET, THEN I'M GOING TO MAKE EVERYONE A CHILD FOREVER. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO AGE AND YOU'LL ALL BE FED STRAWBERRY MILK. YOU'LL ALL BE MY PETS! MUHAHAHA!


*Sophie Goes to Orbis's palace and she tries to beat up Orbis but Orbis turns Sophie into a permanent child.*
 
Sophie: HEY! WHAT THE HECK?


Orbis: You never learn, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO KILL YOU AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE!


Orbis: No you ain't. I'm much stronger than you. I'm the second strongest entity in this town. If you kill me then you kill everyone in this world. I'm not letting you destroy this town with your evil ways, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO KILL Y-


Orbis: Shut up. *puts Sophie to sleep.*


Sophie: N- 


Orbis: That takes care of that.


*Orbis goes to the lab and sees what's going on.*


Orbis: Hey. Um. I don't know why Sophie is going crazy again but uh. I guess I'm going to take over this lab since Sophie is crazy and she is mentally unstable.


Tick: No more being called Tucky?


Orbis: No. You are still Tucky.


Tick: You should know I hate being called Tucky.


Orbis: It's funny.


Tick: GRRRR. MY NAME IS NOT TUCKY!


Orbis: Alright I'll note to call you Tucky.


Tick: I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU!


Orbis: Go ahead and see what happens.


*Tick tries to punch Orbis but he ends up going right through Orbis.*


Orbis: I love annoying Tick. *Teleports in front of Tick* You gotta catch me, Tucky!


Tick: STAND STILL!


Orbis: *Teleports behind Tick.* You are funny. I like annoying you.


*After Orbis annoys Tick for 10 minutes.*


Orbis: Ok guys. What do you kids want to eat?


Troy: Strawberry milk!


Orbis: No. You can't eat that!


Troy: I want it! Give me Strawberry milk!


Orbis: Ok. If that's what you want then ok. *Makes Troy a bottle of Strawberry milk.* There you go.


*Troy drinks the strawberry milk and starts to cry and scream.*


Orbis: Troy, Go to your room.


Troy: Ok! *Goes to me and Sam's room.*


Orbis: Ok Tick. What do you want to eat?


Tick (Pissed off): I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO I WANT? *Stares at Orbis' eyes.*


Orbis: I'm guessing you are still mad at me. I'm just gonna make you some Mac n cheese.*


Tick: *Gasps* MAC AND CHEESE? YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!


Orbis: Why does everyone just scream in my town? This town makes no sense.


Red: I know.


Orbis: Oh. Hi Red. I don't know how I didn't notice you. Anyways, Back to cooking!


*Orbis makes some Mac and cheese for Tick.*


Orbis: Here you go. 


Tick: *Wolfs down the entire batch of Mac and cheese.* Thanks. *Runs back to my room with my Nintendo switch.*


Orbis: Now Luke, What do you want to eat?


Luke: I am not hungry.


Orbis: I can see through your stomach. You are hungry. Now eat.


Luke: Wait. What now?


Orbis: I can see through your stomach.


Luke: NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Orbis: No I'm not getting away from you. You need to eat. Now don't act like a Troy now…


Luke: Don't act like a Troy? Don't you call me a Troy!


Orbis: I can call you whatever you want.


Luke: Oh really? Wanna fight?


Orbis: I don't fight my fellow citizens.


Luke: FIGHT ME.


Orbis: No. 


Luke: BEAT ME.


Orbis: No.


*Red looks at Luke*


Red: You remind me of Troy except you don't spray Strawberry milk on me and run around my pizzeria.


Luke: *Starts to throw a temper tantrum.*


Orbis: Stop it Luke. Don't make me do it…


*Luke doesn't stop.*


*Luke screams as Orbis scares Luke off.*


*Luke runs out of Ohio and runs to Louisiana. Red takes him there.*


Luke: Thanks Red.


*Red flies back to ohio.*


Luke: *I am angry at everyone.*


Young Aaron: IN LOUISIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA!


Luke: GRRR. SHUT UP. YOU ARE ANNOYING ME.


Young Aaron: Waaw! Why ywou mwean?


Luke: Sorry. I'm just angry at people.


Young Aaron: Oh. Iwt owk.


There is a strange force that flings Luke back. When he gets up young Aaron is nowhere to be found.


One week later…


Oakland has been pretty boring ever since Sophie disappeared and orbis took over.


*Luke wakes up in the enchanted magic forest and sees magic hands surrounding him.*


Luke: NO. I CAN'T BE HERE! AHHHHH! *Runs to Red's pizza.*


Luke: RED. I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE!


*Red answers the door.*


Red: How did you get back here from Louisiana?


Luke: I DON'T KNOW BUT I NEED HELP DESTROYING OAKLAND BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! I CAN'T TAKE THIS CONSTANT REPETITIVE LIFE. PLEASE STOP THIS TORTURE!


Red: You want to destroy Oakland and get rid of the magic and weirdness?


Luke: YES. PLEASE END THIS NEVER ENDING TORTURE!


Red: Ok. I'll help. But we need to come up with a plan…


*Epic plan making montage.*


Luke: Alright. Explain the plan to me again?


Red: Ok so we need to get rid of Orbis and Oakland's power. Since you are good at hacking you can distract Orbis while I kill him and destroy his power of Oakland.


Luke: Ok. Let's do this.


*We now enter Red's pov*


Red: *Goes to Orbis's palace and sneaks in.*


*Orbis is watching Young Aaron.*


*Orbis doesn't notice Red.*


*Red snaps Orbis's neck and eats Orbis. Red then nukes Orbis's palace and powerplant.*


*Luke runs away from the explosion and meets Red at Soapbar's palace.*


Luke: I guess this is goodbye. Nah. JUST BLOW EVERYTHING UP!


Red: If you say so. Get on my back. I'll fly to safety.


Luke: K.


*Red flies Luke to safety. Luke watches Oakland get destroyed. Kurtis and Cleetus are with Luke. Romone and the Romanians+ King Aaron are also with Luke.*


*Red blows up Oakland.*


*A weird phenomenon happens where it seems that oakland reverts back to normal in a blink of an eye. It seems that there is something that prevents Oakland's destruction, but what could it be? Everyone is suddenly teleported back to Oakland and some strange border forms around the city. Everyone blacks out and their memories of this day happening were wiped. They all wake up back to where they were originally.* 
Luke: *wakes up* huh.. What a weird dream. Wait a second… THAT WAS REAL! SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BRAINWASH ME! 


*Luke goes to Red's.*


Luke: RED! I NEED YOUR HELP! 


Red: I know. Oakland got resetted again.


Luke: HOW ARE YOU NOT AFFECTED?


Red: I'm a robot. I can't be affected by Oakland.


Luke: WHY DOESN'T THIS NIGHTMARE END???


Red: The only way to end this is to find the source…


Luke: Hmm. Maybe we can catch the thing that resets Oakland.


Red: And since the technology can't be affected, Maybe we could record the reset and see what is causing this.


Luke: Wow. That's actually not a bad idea!


Red: I've seen this happen many times… Where is Cleetus and the others?


Luke: Well, I don't know. Last time I saw them was when we were out of Oakland.


Red: So it seems like something is watching whatever the people do… Almost like a TV show where the director watches everything.


Luke: But this isn't a show. This is reality.


Red: We need to focus on the plan. Let's stop breaking the 4th wall.


Luke: K. So let's get a camera and you record the action since you can't be affected.


*Red gets a camera from somewhere and records Oakland.*


*Luke walks out of the border of Oakland and Oakland resets. Red caught the action on tape.*


Red: I got the recording- Oh right. Everytime Oakland resets, Every living thing is teleported back to the lab and/or their house.


*Luke runs out the lab. Magic hands chase him.*


Luke: RED! I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU. THE WATCHER. THAT'S THE GUY WHO IS CONTROLLING THIS. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS- IT'S UP TO YOU TO SAVE THE WORLD. 


*The magic hands take Luke back to the lab and they treat him like a baby.*


Red: It's up to me, huh?


*Cleetus is heard screaming*


Red: Cleetus? Alright, Watcher. Reveal yourself to me. I want to have a chat.


*The watcher appears.*


The watcher : Hello there. My name is Kyle owner of Oakland. You can call me Kai. I see you have a question of how I run this town… AND THE WORLD!


Red: What have you done to Cleetus?


The Watcher: Oh nothing. 


Red: TELL ME.


The watcher : Let's just say he's all tied up.


Red: STOP THIS AT ONCE.


The Watcher : Oh little Reddie, Soon you'll be just like everyone else. A child.


Red: NO.


The Watcher : Oh? Wanna fight for Oakland now? I'm stronger than everyone in this town. I can easily defeat you…


Red: Let's Play a game….


The Watcher : What kind of game?


Red: Oh you'll see… *Epic fighting montage*
                          
*Red fights the watcher. Red is able to easily kill the watcher.*


*The watcher is at 1% health*


Red: Now… Prepare to… DiEeEeEeEeEeEe…


*Red kills the watcher*


*The borders disappear. The magic hands let go of everyone.*


*Everyone is free to leave.*


*Luke leaves Oakland.*


Luke: I'M FREEEEEEEEEEE! 


*All the ghost people rise from the grave and start chasing Troy out of Oakland.*


*Troy is officially in a new town. Luke is in a new town. Red stays in Oakland with Cleetus. All seems well.*




















*The watcher comes back to life.*


The watcher : Hahaha… that was my clone! You really think you could defeat me?


*The watcher brings everyone back to Oakland and puts the border back over Oakland.*


Luke: GRRRRRRRRRRRR! 


The Watcher : Sorry Red but… *Kicks Red out of Oakland and puts a metal forcefield over Oakland.*


Luke: AHHHHH! WE ARE ALL HOPELESS! EVERYONE, RUN!!!!!


*Troy drinks his Strawberry milk and looks at the watcher. He just stares at the watcher.*


The watcher : Hello Troy! What are you doing? 


Troy: Drinking my Strawberry milk!


The watcher : Well what if I gave you an unlimited supply of this stuff? All you gotta do is convince your friends to drink it and make sure to do what the magic hands do then you can have all the Strawberry milk you want!


Troy: So I just do what I do to Sam but i do it to everyone?


The watcher : Yes.


Troy: Okie! *I notice Luke and I run up to him.*


Troy: *Grabs Luke and force feeds him Strawberry milk then hugs him.* Hey Lukie!


Luke: *Tries to force Troy off of me but Troy doesn't stop. Starts to become sleepy and starts to become like Troy.* 


Troy: Aww! Now onto my other fwiends!


*Troy turns everyone into a Troy and the watcher puts hypnosis helmets on everyone.*


The watcher : Repeat after me. I will not be evil. I will do what the watcher tells me to do.


*Meanwhile with Red.*


Red: *Tries to get in.* WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE PEOPLE IN THERE?


*Red sees everyone brainwashed.*


Red: What the- What the heck is happening?


The watcher : *Teleports Red into Oakland.* I'm glad you asked! I just made everyone like Troy!


Red: YOU BRAINWASHED AND HYPNOTIZED THESE… KIDS?


The watcher : I'm only protecting them…


Red: STOP BRAINWASHING THEM!


*To be continued…*

Kale: Sounds fun!


Duke: I’m down.


Elese: Alright! Now if I could just find my portal gun then we could- *Sees my magic portal gun* Aha! Found it! *I open a portal to the wrong dimension and I try to close the portal. Duke gets sucked into the portal and the portal closes.*


Kale: Oh no! Duke got sucked into the portal! What do we do?


Elese: I think the portal gun is broken. I’m going to fix it then we need to open the portal. For now though, Just chill out.


*Meanwhile with Duke*


*Duke gets up. He is now in a dimension full of nice, gentle and friendly angels with powers! Duke won’t like that…*


*Duke looks around. Duke is terrified.*


*A angel flies down to Duke.*


Angey: Hello! My name is Angey! You must be a small human child! What’s your name, Child?


Duke: AHHHH! NO! MY NIGHTMARES ARE REAL!!!!! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Angey: Hey! Are you-


*Duke starts to cry.*


Angey: Woah! Please don’t cry! It’s ok! 


*All the angels see Duke crying and they fly over to Duke and hug him and play with him. The angels begin to comfort Duke and try to calm Duke down. Duke starts to turn red and Duke’s eyes go wide. The angels use their angel powers to do everything they can to help Duke but Duke is still mentally hurt.*


*One of the angels uses their mind healing powers to heal Duke’s mind. Duke starts to cry even more. The angels hug and cuddle Duke and they begin to cry with Duke. Duke realizes these angels are not a threat and Duke calms down. Duke is then introduced to angel city and the angels protect Duke. They teach Duke about their leader, God and how they praise him and worship him. The angels introduce Duke to worship music and the angels take care of Duke.*


*Meanwhile, Elese and Kale have fixed the portal gun and they go into the dimension. They enter into the angel dimension and the angels all welcome Kale and Elese. Duke runs to Kale and hugs him. The angels wave goodbye to Duke and the others and the angels resume their normal activity.*


*Duke has a good life*


*End of story*
Hey guys, Young Aaron here. Today we are going to be talking about how we can improve the Young Aaron personality. If you don't know what Young Aaron is, He is a young version of modern day Tick. Tick decided to revive his young self because he enjoys his younger self but he wants to change his younger self to be better. Young Aaron is the official mascot of the Tick YouTube channel and Tick has decided to make a series about it. By the way, The T.G.O.G series will continue. I am not ending it. I'm just thinking of new episode ideas. Now, Without further Ado, Let's begin today's Young Aaron research. This is the first time I am researching but I hope it goes well. So, Let's start our research.


Alright guys. So the first step to building a better Young me is to eliminate evil and replace it with good and nurture the kid with Compassion and kindness. That way, It'll make young Aaron less of an evil kid and more of a nicer kid! We also should eliminate bullying as bullying is not allowed on my channel. We also need to make sure Young Aaron's character is respectful, Kid-like and innocent but not hurtful or mean to others. We need to make sure Young Aaron can help others be Christian and that is do what I plan to do. I plan to make everyone better persons and Christians. Now that we got all the big important info out of the way, Let's talk about what videos I will be making! So I will be making some very respectful videos that teach people lessons. I will also be making some narrations, I'll be doing many different things just like Tick! I'll also be helping you guys out AND I'LL BE DOING LIVE STREAMS! IT'LL BE SO FUN! My streams will be very different from Tick's streams though. So, What other things will I be talking about in this research? Nothing. I've run out of ideas for this research. (WHY DO I PLAY AMERICAN IDOL? I DON'T WAAAAAANA PLAY IT ANYMORE DO LET'S HIDE IN THE OLD DAYS AND PLAY AMERICAN IDOL WHILE DRINKING A CUP OF GREEN TEA. This will be spoken in a very dramatic and deep funny voice.)

I  PRESENT  TO YOU the one the only made by me
IN THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By: AARON
What people need to know is that i think i could spend time with my friends in the future because they care about me. for exzample i went a abanded arcade place that has animatronics that still work, also i enjoy playing the arcade there, my friends are also nice to me, and we have fun exploring i went to the ambaned pizza place for exzample they have a old maskout chuck e cheese, and the animatronic band is 101 lbs. I had to call a tow truck that could lift it. I will have to call the tow truck tommrow.
Since the animatronics are still at the pizza place i maby[c] i could haul the animatronics to my house. But the problem is i can`t haul the animatronic band in my mom`s car. So i will have to call a tow truck to tow today it can just pick up the broken parts and tow it to my house. I have solved the problem. So if you ever want a animatronic band just go to a abanded pizza place that has animatronics that still work un plug the animatronic, then call a tow truck, finley wait till the tow truck comes to your house then you will have a animatronic band.  I hope you enjoyed my document bye bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So one day at reds redthebear was hm….. Let's see here i think he was… oh i remember! He was kissing roxy. Also another day at romones he was feeding clammy but than clammy broke the wall of jawbreaker. So meanwhile at reds, red was still kissing roxy when suddenly the phone rang. Red answered it and romone said something. “Hey red how ya do- but… this is not what the story is about… this is about the war of video games... all of the video games in the universe went into war…… so another day at reds red was panicking because of the war and he was smashing the walls and tipping over the ball pit and all of the balls slid down stairs and scattered all over the place “red why are you going crazy?” “OMG CAN'T YOU SEE? THERE IS A WAR OUT THERE!!!” so meanwhile in romones clammy could not stop eating romone and romone accidentally killed clammy and killed lamone in his romone pack “ romone, you gotta stop doing this!!!! You're trashing the palace and we have a low amount of survivors because of you!!!!” “ WELL TO BAD YOU GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF DUMB AND STUPID CANDY WEAKLINGS!!!!!!” meanwhile at reds again red has calmed down and apologised and now he is fixing the walls and ball pit. “ hey red i know it is rough out there and i know it made you panic.” “ well i was thinking... remember that time when i stopped that nuke? You helped me! and if we survived that we can survive anything so let's go out there and show them whos boss!!!!” “ ya let's go!” so they went into the war and killed tons of characters. Meanwhile at romones romone still was not calmed down yet. I WILL kill you romone pack  ha ha ha ha ha! Any last words?” “romone your crazy ‘gets a gun and clammy eats it. “ HAHAHAHA DIE *threw acid at the romone pack.”  yes i killed ramone because i blocked it and it bounced off at ramone HA HA i can't die BUT YOU CAN!!! DIE *clammy eats ramone pack* GOOD JOB CLAMMY SO YOUR NOT SO USELESS WHAT DID YOU SAY? Meanwhile at the war red and roxy were hiding from spring snap “ok maybe this was a bad idea was it roxy?” “yeah i guess… WAIT! You can use you're special powers together!!” “but how?” “believe.” “fine.” then red did his ultra power demon moves and said “may the black dove always carry you.” and all the video games got sucked back into their original games. Romone looked at the candy tv very bored and flipping through the channels, all of a sudden, the news flipped on and said “breaking news, the town of las vegas has been saved by redthebear once again!!” romone sighed as he said “i wish i could meet him, oh wait! I can I'LL JUST MAKE A PORTAL!!!” so he built a portal and turned it on waiting for red to go in it.

“The time I lied and regretted it...”
One exhausting summer day, Me, My mom Tatra, My sister Toti
and my sister’s friend Margy all met up and went to the park. My
mom Tatra said, “Now I am going to go for a walk with Margy’s
mom. Here are the rules... Rule 1. Don’t rough house or
anything. Rule 2. Do not leave the park unless we say you guys
can. Rule 3. Don’t go in the woods. Got it?” Then I said, “Yes
Mom. We got it.” Toti also said “Yes, we got it. We’ll follow the
rules...” Tatra, my mom said “Ok. Now you kids go do whatever
you kids do these days.” I said “Ok.” Then me and Toti went to
swing on the swings. 30 minutes later I decided to go see what
Margy was doing and Margy was on her cell phone googling
random things. A few minutes later, Margy decided to come to
us and she said this “ Hey guys. Wanna play tag?” I said sure.
Toti said “sure why not?” So we played tag for 1 hour and after
playing tag, Margy went to her original location and went on her
phone. Then Margy got off her cell phone and went to us, and
she asked both of us “Hey guys! Do you want to break a rule that
we aren’t supposed to break?” I said “Um. I don’t mean to be a
party pooper but... Don’t you think that is a bad idea? We might
get in trouble!” Margy said “Oh shut up! We won’t get caught if
we don’t tell them!” My sister Toti said “I’m down!” Margy said
“Come on Aaron! Let’s go to the woods! I promise they won’t find
out!” So I said “Ok as long as they don’t find out...” Oh but boy
was I wrong! So we went far into the woods that Tatra specifically
told us not to go into. Then after 40 minutes of playing in the
woods, We came out and Margy said “See? I told you our moms
won’t find out!” Tatra knew we were in the woods all along and
came up to us and said “Were you guys in those woods? I
thought I heard you guys there...” Margy said “this was all
Aaron’s idea! I had nothing to do with it!” Tatra said “You are in a
lot of trouble mister!” Then Margy’s mom took Margy home and
Tatra took us home. As soon as I came in the door of my house
Tatra said “I can’t believe you two would go in the woods! For
breaking my rules you both are grounded for one month!” I said “But Mom! I- I- I didn’t do it! It was Margy! Please! BELIEVE
ME!!!!” Tatra said “I have heard enough YOU ARE
GROUNDED!!!!” As I went into my room, I planned to prove my
innocence. So I came up with a plan. One month later when I got
ungrounded, We went to the park again but this time i got my
phone. So Margy went into the woods and she started bragging
about how she wasn’t going to be in trouble and that I was. The
whole time she said that, I was recording her. So after she
stopped bragging she said “What are you doing?” I said “Um...
Nothing?” I ran to Tatra and explained to her what happened, and
I showed Margy’s mom the video. Margy ran up to my mom and
said “Mrs. Tatra! It wasn’t me! I was framed!”
Her mom came up to her and said “It wasn’t you? Then why does
that video show proof? Are you lying?” Margy said “No! I was
framed!” Margy’s mom said “YOU FRAMED AARON!!! When we
get home you are in a lot of trouble Missy...”
Margy’s mom dragged Margy home.
Margy got grounded. My mom said “I’m sorry for blaming you...
you are a good kid and you’d never do this.” I said “It’s ok mom. I
understand. Margy’s mom called Tatra and apologized. Margy
got disciplined. Margy never went into those woods again.

GREEN GUY: AND I”M CLAMMY: hello Elese: What are 




*There was a boy who was 13. There was also a girl who was 10. These two kids lived together. The boy would always get  teased by the girl. One day, The boy became silent. He would avoid the girl completely. The boy was named Kyle and the girl was named Cecilia. Let's see what happens next!


*Present day*


Cecila: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Tries to find Kyle. I can't find him. I notice a note at the front door. It's from Kyle.* A note? Not again… Probably ANOTHER STUPID NOTE ABOUT WORK OR HOW HE'S "Sorry"... WHAT A PATHETIC DISGUSTING BROTHER I HAVE.


*The note reads "Hello, Ceceila. If you are reading this, Well, I'm leaving. I'm going to do what you told me to do! Jump off a bridge and die! I'm going to never be around you again. I'm going to leave. You'll never see me again. Goodbye forever."*


Cecila : I don't give a crap if he's dead!


*Meanwhile with Kyle.*


Kyle: Well, Time to die…


*Someone notices Kyle about to jump. The person grabs Kyle and hugs him.*


Samantha: Sir, Please tell me, Why did you want to jump?


Kyle: My family doesn't care about me.


Samantha: But you are so young! You have so much to learn.


Kyle: Nobody gives a care about me.


Samantha: Well I "give a" care about you.


Kyle: Really?


Samantha: Yeah. How about I take you to my house? It's pretty close by to where we are!


Kyle: O-Okay.


*Samantha takes Kyle to his house.*


Samantha: Well, Here we are?


Kyle: WE ARE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD! Are you my neighbor?


Samantha: I guess so?


Kyle: My family lives here…


Samantha: Don't worry. I'll protect you from your family.


Kyle: Thank you.


*A few days later.*


Kyle: Hey Samantha?


Samantha: Yeah?


Kyle: You know that one show called the story series?


Samantha: Mhm, What about it?


Kyle: Can we try to revive it?


Samantha: Well I happen to know the creator so yeah! 


Kyle: Ok!


*Meanwhile with Cecilia*


Cecila : I miss mom and dad… Now that Kyle is gone… I can't talk to anyone… I didn't mean to hurt him! I thought I was joking with him! Well, It's too late for me to apologize to Kyle since he's dead. *Cries* I miss Kyle!


*Cecila pulls herself together.*


Cecila : Maybe I'll go on a walk. That'll clear my head!


*Cecila walks out of her house. She decides to see what her neighbor is up to. Cecila knocks on the neighbor's door.*


Samantha: *Hears the knock.* Oh! I'll get it!


*Samantha answers the door. Kyle sees Cecilia and hides under his bed.*


Samantha: Hi! How can I help you, Neighbor?


Cecila : I want to talk about something…


Samantha: Have you been crying?


Cecila : Yeah. I miss my family…


Samantha: Come on in. I'll make you some Strawberry milk. Maybe my friend can cheer you up or something.


Cecila : That'd be nice.


*Cecila comes in Samantha's house and makes herself comfy.*


Samantha: I'll get you some Strawberry milk.


Cecila : Ok.


*Cecila looks around.* I really miss mom and dad…


*Kyle covers his ears.*


Kyle: Ugh. All she cared about was mom… I'm not listening to anything.


Cecila : I also cared about my brother, Kyle. He means the world to me.


Samantha: Sounds like you have a nice family.


Cecila : Yeah. I just miss them.


Samantha: You know, What's funny is I have a friend called Kyle!


Cecila : What. Take me to him!


Samantha: *Brings Cecilia into the guest bedroom.* He should be in here somewhere- *Sees Kyle under the bed and drags him out from under the bed.*


Kyle: *Tries to hold on but is lifted up and revealed to Cecilia.*


Cecila : It really is him… I thought he died!


Samantha: Huh? What do you mean?


*Kyle runs out the room.*


Cecila : Great. He ran out of the room. Well, That Kyle is my brother.


Samantha: He told me some things about you…


Cecila : I know. I've been awful to him but I decided to become nicer and I wanted to apologize to him.


Samantha: That's good. Maybe you can invite him for dinner at your house?


Cecila : He'll just run off when he sees me.


Samantha: Oh. Maybe I can keep him still?


Cecila: He'll be scarred for life if he sees me. He'll think we're bullying him.


Samantha: Can we both hug him then?


Cecila : Maybe that'll work but I don't know if he'll be ok with that…


Samantha: Ok. Well, let's try it. I'll go in first.


*Kyle can overhear the conversation.*


*Samantha comes into Kyle's room.


Kyle: *Screams and runs around the room.*


Samantha: Kyle! It's okay! It's just me!


*Samantha grabs Kyle and hugs him. Cecila comes into the room and hugs Kyle.*


Kyle: *Screams and squirms around. Shaking violently.*


Samantha: Kyle! We're just trying to hug you! Please calm down!


Kyle: *Doesn't stop.*


Samantha: PLEASE CALM DOWN!


Cecila : I don't think he likes this…


Samantha: This clearly isn't working. *Lets Kyle free.*


Kyle: *Runs off. Goes under my bed.*


Cecila : I think I may have one other solution to our problem.


Kyle: What is it?


Cecila : There was this old show that Kyle used to watch called The Story Series. It ended a week ago. Maybe if we revive it then we can get some answers from the characters on what to do.


Samantha: Ok. *Turns on a TV* No way… It says here that somebody already revived the story series! I think I have a idea. Ok so hear me out. If we can replicate Sophie's magic staff, Then we could travel to Oakland through a portal and have Sophie fix Kyle, and thus, We'd be featured on a Story Series show!


Cecila : But the author clearly says that it ended!
Samantha: Let's go pay the author a visit…


*Samantha goes to Aaron's house.*


Samantha: Excuse me, Is this where the author of the story series lives?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Why yes it is! The name's Aaron. Aaron. J. Hebbler. I'm the writer and producer of the story series.


Samantha: Why did you end the series?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: LD took over my series. He possessed the watcher and now everyone in Oakland is unsafe. Everyone in Oakland is going cookoo crazy and my series is dying. If only I could have some executive producer for my show.


Samantha: Why don't I help?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Writing a story takes tons of work. You'd need hundreds of bottles of green tea and you'd need powerful music to be a able to write the stories that I write. Are you sure you want to do this?


Samantha: Teach me the way of the story series. Train me.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Ok. *Gets a carpet. Sets up the carpet and grabs some green tea bottles. Place 2 next to me and 2 on the other side of the carpet.* Sit down and drink your tea. Close your eyes and think of ideas.


Samantha: Ok. *Drinks green tea and thinks.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Think about your idea and write. You are now trained in the art of Story Series.


Samantha: *Bows to Aaron* Thank you, Sensei Aaron.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: No prob. Now write the story with me! We are going to continue this series!


*Meanwhile in the story series world.*


Lord Conner (LD): HAHAHA! YOU FOOLS! I NOW RULE OAKLAND! YOU CAN'T STOP ME! SURRENDER TO ME! YOUR PRECIOUS WATCHER IS GONE… I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REALLY THOUGHT THE WATCHER BRAINWASHED YOU! BY KILLING HIM, YOU DESTROYED THIS BORDER AND NOW, I CAN FINALLY KILL EVERYONE IN THE WORLD- *Cage appears and locks Lord Conner in. The watcher comes out of the ground and is angry at LD.*


The Watcher : Haha! I am revived! Thanks Aaron!


Aaron (Story series version): No prob!


The watcher : NOBODY ENSLAVES MY PEOPLE! *Rebuilds the border and rebuilds the buildings. Rebuilds everything. Restores Oakland and its compassionate people. Revives Orbis and all the Oakland laws. Puts Red back in Cincinnati and turns Lord Conner into a child. Puts Lord Conner in a maximum security mental health hospital. Removes all the evilness and replaces it with good in every evil character. Revives everything magic. Restores Oakland completely. Restores the USB and magic book. Restores Elese and all the older characters. Removes the glitches and bugs. Revives everything good and fixes everything.* Oakland is restored! Now my people, Have fun again and don't fall for Lord Conner's brainwashings. I never brainwashed anyone. Now go on, Have some fun all my children who are all children! You will no longer be hurt and its thanks to God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit and for Aaron. Thank you very much and goodnight, Oakland!


*It is now night in Oakland and all the children go to sleep.*


The watcher : *Watches over my mighty town. The protection of God is over this town.* Ah, What a great day. I'll go take care of Red later…


*We now go back to the other universe with Kyle and his friends and family.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: We did it! We saved Oakland! Now there can be a 5th generation of the story series! Thank you, Samantha! To show you my gratitude, I will make you a portal to Oakland where you shall live and be happy with all your friends and family. You shall be a child and live in peace and harmony. Now go, Have fun in Oakland. But just note, It's night time there so be very quiet! Okay?


Samantha: Thanks for all your help!




*Samantha goes back to my house with Cecilia waiting there.*


Cecila: So, How'd it go?


Samantha: Pretty good!


Cecila: Can we go to Oakland?


Samantha: Yep! Just open the box and everyone will be in Oakland!


Cecila: Nice!


*Kyle hides under the bed.*


Samantha: The author will make us our own lab and it will be combined with Sophie's lab and Elese's lab to make one big lab! We just open the gift and we'll be teleported to Oakland. Just know it's night so we gotta be quiet.


Cecila: Oh, Ok!


*Samantha opens the box and the box does exactly what Samantha says.*


*Samantha is now in her own lab.*


*Kyle is hiding under a bed.*


*Sophie is in her lab and she notices a new lab. She opens the lab door and sees Samantha.*


Sophie : Hey new neighbors! 


Samantha: Hi there!


*Kyle notices Sophie and passes out.*


Cecila: Hello. I'm Cecila and this is Samantha,


Samantha: Hiiiii!


Cecila: And Kyle who is hiding under the bed.


Sophie : Oh! He's just like Troy! Maybe in the morning, Those two kids can play.


Cecila: Certainly!


Sophie : Well, Imma hit the hay, We can fully meet each other tomorrow.


Cecila: Okay. Nighty night.


*Sophie Goes to her room and sleeps.*


Samantha: Alright Cecila, Goodnight.


Cecila: Night. *Turns off the lights.*


*Cecila goes to sleep.*


*Kyle sneaks out of the lab door and goes to Sophie's lab.*


*Troy sneaks out of his room and notices Kyle. Kyle notices Troy.*


Troy: Hi.


Kyle: Hi.


Kyle: What's your name?


Troy: Troy. What's yours?


Kyle: Kyle.


Troy: Did your sister torment you?


Kyle: Mhm.


Troy: Same.


*A magic hand is holding a flashlight. It hears a noise so it goes out of Sophie's room and goes down to the kitchen. The hand notices Kyle and Troy awake and the hand gets a Strawberry milk bottle.*


Troy: RUN!


Kyle: WHAT IS THAT THING?


Troy: It's Sophie's magic hands. They are making sure we have a good sleep and they make sure we are healthy. The hands think that we freak out that we are not healthy and happy do they feed us strawberry milk so we don't cry. They are really good but they kinda scare me. The hands are playing with us right now so we should probably run. You don't want the hands to make you laugh. Once they play, They make sure you are happy. I'm okay with it but i don't like it when the hands pet my head because it makes me cry but i love it when I am fed strawberry milk and healed.


Kyle: AH! I DON'T LIKE IT!


Troy: I'll protect you. *Hugs and holds onto Kyle gently. Making sure magic hands don't make Kyle scared.*


*The magic hand tries to touch Kyle.*


Troy: NO. MAGIC HAND, NO. KYLE IS NEW TO THIS. HE IS ACTUALLY SCARED OF YOU. PLEASE DON'T PLAY WITH HIM.


*The magic hand does a thumbs up and makes a special bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle and makes a normal strawberry milk bottle for Troy. The magic hand feeds the strawberry milk bottle to Troy and Troy grabs the bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle.*


Troy: I can feed the bottle to Kyle.


*The magic hand goes to the back of the room and watches.*


Troy: The magic hand is not near us anymore. Let me feed the strawberry milk to you and we'll cuddle and sleep next to each other. I'll protect you.


Kyle: Okie. 


*Kyle drinks the Strawberry milk and falls asleep. Troy also falls asleep and holds onto Kyle and hugs him. Kyle coos and Troy coos. The magic hand cleans up the magic strawberry milk bottle mess and puts a blanket over Troy and Kyle. The hand pars Troy and goes upstairs to the magic hands room and goes to sleep next to the other magic hands.*


*The next morning.*


Sophie : *Goes to the kitchen with the magic hands.* Aww! It looks like Kyle and Troy got along! Come on magic hands, Go eat your magic strawberry milk dust. I'm going to wake up Kyle and Troy.


Sophie : *Takes the blanket off Troy. Begins to hug Troy.*


Troy: *Wakes up and smiles* Hey Sophie!


Sophie : Hey Troy! Did you have a good sleep?


Troy: Yeah!


*Sophie is about to playfully wake up Kyle as well.*


Troy: Sophie. Remember the kid that became depressed when you played with him? You know how he hated it when you played with him?


Sophie : Yeah?


Troy: Do you want Kyle to have a heart attack? Kyle doesn't like being playfully waken up and he doesn't like playful people so please, Let me wake him up.


Sophie : Sorry. I didn't know that Kyle wasn't a playful kid. I'll let you wake him up.


*Troy hugs and holds and cuddles Kyle and wakes Kyle up.*


Kyle: *Wakes up and hugs Troy. Cries from a nightmare.*


Troy: *Feeds Strawberry milk to Kyle.* Shh, Shh. It's okay. What's wrong?


Kyle: Nightmare.


Troy: The nightmare is gone. I'm here for you.


Kyle: *Feels better.* Thankie!


Troy: No probbie!


*While Sophie and the others are carrying on their day, Let's see the magic hands morning routine!




*Morning routine.*


*The magic hands wake up and tickle Sophie. They playfully help her get ready and the magic hands go to the magic forest. They begin chasing each other and playing. An enemy approaches. Oh no! It's the evil magic hands! The magic hands fight the evil magic hands. The magic hands win and the evil magic hands become good magic hands and join Sophie's magic hand army. The magic hands go back to the lab and spend some time with the people in the lab then they spread all throughout Oakland and make others happy.*


*That is what the magic hands do everyday.*


*Back to Sophie. We now rejoin Sophie going to meet some of her old friends.*


Sophie : Hey guys! I missed you!


*Sophie takes her friends to the lab and she makes a room for them.*


*End of story. Story Series 5 coming soon.*
Continuation of the last Troy story. 


A month has passed since Troy's death…


Sophie: I really miss troy…


She builds some sort of resurrection machine and is somehow able to revive Troy, only now he has no memories of anything or anyone in Oakland.

Mark: Oh I know how to handle this. Ok Troy. So you are a dog and you are named Petie.

*Red appears*


Sophie: Red? What are you doing here? I thought you moved out of Ohio?


Red: I did but I sensed that Troy was still alive.


Sophie: Yes, Yes. Troy is alive but he has no memories of anything. For some reason, Troy still looks like he's 13 even though he's 20.


Red: Probably because people look younger in this town.

*Sophie opens the door of Tick's room and her eyes open wide. Sophie sees a room full of androids that are painted to look like certain characters.*


Sophie: WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

Sophie: This whole time I'VE BEEN WITH AN ANDROID? HOW LONG WAS TROY DEAD FOR?


Tick: 32 years.

Tick: I'm… Not even alive.


Sophie: What? What the heck do you mean?


Tick: I'm a Android.


Sophie: IS EVERYONE AN ANDROID? AHHHHHHHHH!




*Sophie wakes up in her room and panics. She looks around and calms down. Sophie sees Troy sleeping in the corner with a bottle of Strawberry milk in his hands.*


Sophie: So Troy never died? Oh wow. What a crazy dream. What time is it? *Looks at my watch.* Oh. It's only 7 am. I'm going to get up and wake Troy up.


*Sophie gets up and drinks some wake up Strawberry milk. Sophie then gives Troy some wake up Strawberry milk and Troy wakes up.*


Troy: Morning, Sophie.

Troy: Can I go sleep with my amor?


Sophie: Your love?

Troy: Okie.


*Sophie Goes downstairs and she cooks some breakfast. Sophie decides to go to the pet store to buy a pet.*


*Sophie gets a pet and goes back home.*


Sophie: I think I'm going to name you Petie.


*Troy comes out of Sam's room and sees the dog. Troy grabs a pacifier and some Strawberry milk and starts running towards the dog.*


Sophie: TROY WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PETIE?


*Troy gives Petie the Strawberry milk and puts the pacifier in Petie's mouth.*


Sophie: TROY! YOU TURNED PETIE INTO A TROY!


Troy: I'm naming you Troy JR.


Petie: Woof! 


Troy: Hey Petie! You want some chicken sauce?


Petie: Bleh!🤮


Troy: Strawberry milk?


Petie: Woof! 😄


Troy: Good Troy JR.


*We now go to Romone and Red.*


*Romone Wakes up and knocks on Red's door.*


*Red answers the door.*


Red: What is it?


Romone: Uhh. Something SUSSY is going on in the lab and I need help.


Red: Ok.


*Romone takes Red to the lab.*


Red: So what's going on?


Romone: Look at Sophie.


Red: Uh. Why is there a dog that is being treated like a Troy?


Romone: Um. I don't know.

Sophie: Hi Red! What are you and Romone doing here?


Romone: What are you doing to that poor dog?


Sophie: I'm just treating it like I treat Troy!


Romone: Let go of the dog.

*The dog starts crying like a Troy.*


Petie: WOOOOOOOOOOF!


Red: What… Did you do to the dog?


Romone: She turned it into a Troy.

Sophie: The dog is gonna die from sugar if he lives with you!


Romone: I have special candy for dogs. He'll be completely fine.


Sophie: Then if I can't have a pet then… I'm going to turn everyone into a Troy…


*Sophie kicks Red and Romone out of her lab and she locks the door. Sophie sees Tick and Troy eating. Sophie looks at Tick with delight.*


Sophie: Hehehe. *Sneaks behind Tick and waits for him to finish eating. Then I snatch Tick.*


Troy: Sophie, What are you doing to Tick?


Sophie: Tick is gonna be my pet!


Troy: Oh no no no! You've already done this.


Sophie: IF I CAN'T TURN ANYONE INTO A PET, THEN I'M GOING TO MAKE EVERYONE A CHILD FOREVER. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO AGE AND YOU'LL ALL BE FED STRAWBERRY MILK. YOU'LL ALL BE MY PETS! MUHAHAHA!


*Sophie Goes to Orbis's palace and she tries to beat up Orbis but Orbis turns Sophie into a permanent child.*
 
Sophie: HEY! WHAT THE HECK?


Orbis: You never learn, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO KILL YOU AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE!


Orbis: No you ain't. I'm much stronger than you. I'm the second strongest entity in this town. If you kill me then you kill everyone in this world. I'm not letting you destroy this town with your evil ways, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO KILL Y-


Orbis: Shut up. *puts Sophie to sleep.*


Sophie: N- 


Orbis: That takes care of that.


*Orbis goes to the lab and sees what's going on.*


Orbis: Hey. Um. I don't know why Sophie is going crazy again but uh. I guess I'm going to take over this lab since Sophie is crazy and she is mentally unstable.


Tick: No more being called Tucky?


Orbis: No. You are still Tucky.


Tick: You should know I hate being called Tucky.


Orbis: It's funny.


Tick: GRRRR. MY NAME IS NOT TUCKY!


Orbis: Alright I'll note to call you Tucky.


Tick: I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU!


Orbis: Go ahead and see what happens.


*Tick tries to punch Orbis but he ends up going right through Orbis.*


Orbis: I love annoying Tick. *Teleports in front of Tick* You gotta catch me, Tucky!


Tick: STAND STILL!


Orbis: *Teleports behind Tick.* You are funny. I like annoying you.


*After Orbis annoys Tick for 10 minutes.*


Orbis: Ok guys. What do you kids want to eat?


Troy: Strawberry milk!


Orbis: No. You can't eat that!


Troy: I want it! Give me Strawberry milk!


Orbis: Ok. If that's what you want then ok. *Makes Troy a bottle of Strawberry milk.* There you go.


*Troy drinks the strawberry milk and starts to cry and scream.*


Orbis: Troy, Go to your room.


Troy: Ok! *Goes to me and Sam's room.*


Orbis: Ok Tick. What do you want to eat?


Tick (Pissed off): I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO I WANT? *Stares at Orbis' eyes.*


Orbis: I'm guessing you are still mad at me. I'm just gonna make you some Mac n cheese.*


Tick: *Gasps* MAC AND CHEESE? YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!


Orbis: Why does everyone just scream in my town? This town makes no sense.


Red: I know.


Orbis: Oh. Hi Red. I don't know how I didn't notice you. Anyways, Back to cooking!


*Orbis makes some Mac and cheese for Tick.*


Orbis: Here you go. 


Tick: *Wolfs down the entire batch of Mac and cheese.* Thanks. *Runs back to my room with my Nintendo switch.*


Orbis: Now Luke, What do you want to eat?


Luke: I am not hungry.


Orbis: I can see through your stomach. You are hungry. Now eat.


Luke: Wait. What now?


Orbis: I can see through your stomach.


Luke: NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Orbis: No I'm not getting away from you. You need to eat. Now don't act like a Troy now…


Luke: Don't act like a Troy? Don't you call me a Troy!


Orbis: I can call you whatever you want.


Luke: Oh really? Wanna fight?


Orbis: I don't fight my fellow citizens.


Luke: FIGHT ME.


Orbis: No. 


Luke: BEAT ME.


Orbis: No.


*Red looks at Luke*


Red: You remind me of Troy except you don't spray Strawberry milk on me and run around my pizzeria.


Luke: *Starts to throw a temper tantrum.*


Orbis: Stop it Luke. Don't make me do it…


*Luke doesn't stop.*


*Luke screams as Orbis scares Luke off.*


*Luke runs out of Ohio and runs to Louisiana. Red takes him there.*


Luke: Thanks Red.


*Red flies back to ohio.*


Luke: *I am angry at everyone.*


Young Aaron: IN LOUISIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA!


Luke: GRRR. SHUT UP. YOU ARE ANNOYING ME.


Young Aaron: Waaw! Why ywou mwean?


Luke: Sorry. I'm just angry at people.


Young Aaron: Oh. Iwt owk.


There is a strange force that flings Luke back. When he gets up young Aaron is nowhere to be found.


One week later…


Oakland has been pretty boring ever since Sophie disappeared and orbis took over.


*Luke wakes up in the enchanted magic forest and sees magic hands surrounding him.*


Luke: NO. I CAN'T BE HERE! AHHHHH! *Runs to Red's pizza.*


Luke: RED. I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE!


*Red answers the door.*


Red: How did you get back here from Louisiana?


Luke: I DON'T KNOW BUT I NEED HELP DESTROYING OAKLAND BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! I CAN'T TAKE THIS CONSTANT REPETITIVE LIFE. PLEASE STOP THIS TORTURE!


Red: You want to destroy Oakland and get rid of the magic and weirdness?


Luke: YES. PLEASE END THIS NEVER ENDING TORTURE!


Red: Ok. I'll help. But we need to come up with a plan…


*Epic plan making montage.*


Luke: Alright. Explain the plan to me again?


Red: Ok so we need to get rid of Orbis and Oakland's power. Since you are good at hacking you can distract Orbis while I kill him and destroy his power of Oakland.


Luke: Ok. Let's do this.


*We now enter Red's pov*


Red: *Goes to Orbis's palace and sneaks in.*


*Orbis is watching Young Aaron.*


*Orbis doesn't notice Red.*


*Red snaps Orbis's neck and eats Orbis. Red then nukes Orbis's palace and powerplant.*


*Luke runs away from the explosion and meets Red at Soapbar's palace.*


Luke: I guess this is goodbye. Nah. JUST BLOW EVERYTHING UP!


Red: If you say so. Get on my back. I'll fly to safety.


Luke: K.


*Red flies Luke to safety. Luke watches Oakland get destroyed. Kurtis and Cleetus are with Luke. Romone and the Romanians+ King Aaron are also with Luke.*


*Red blows up Oakland.*


*A weird phenomenon happens where it seems that oakland reverts back to normal in a blink of an eye. It seems that there is something that prevents Oakland's destruction, but what could it be? Everyone is suddenly teleported back to Oakland and some strange border forms around the city. Everyone blacks out and their memories of this day happening were wiped. They all wake up back to where they were originally.* 
Luke: *wakes up* huh.. What a weird dream. Wait a second… THAT WAS REAL! SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BRAINWASH ME! 


*Luke goes to Red's.*


Luke: RED! I NEED YOUR HELP! 


Red: I know. Oakland got resetted again.


Luke: HOW ARE YOU NOT AFFECTED?


Red: I'm a robot. I can't be affected by Oakland.


Luke: WHY DOESN'T THIS NIGHTMARE END???


Red: The only way to end this is to find the source…


Luke: Hmm. Maybe we can catch the thing that resets Oakland.


Red: And since the technology can't be affected, Maybe we could record the reset and see what is causing this.


Luke: Wow. That's actually not a bad idea!


Red: I've seen this happen many times… Where is Cleetus and the others?


Luke: Well, I don't know. Last time I saw them was when we were out of Oakland.


Red: So it seems like something is watching whatever the people do… Almost like a TV show where the director watches everything.


Luke: But this isn't a show. This is reality.


Red: We need to focus on the plan. Let's stop breaking the 4th wall.


Luke: K. So let's get a camera and you record the action since you can't be affected.


*Red gets a camera from somewhere and records Oakland.*


*Luke walks out of the border of Oakland and Oakland resets. Red caught the action on tape.*


Red: I got the recording- Oh right. Everytime Oakland resets, Every living thing is teleported back to the lab and/or their house.


*Luke runs out the lab. Magic hands chase him.*


Luke: RED! I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU. THE WATCHER. THAT'S THE GUY WHO IS CONTROLLING THIS. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS- IT'S UP TO YOU TO SAVE THE WORLD. 


*The magic hands take Luke back to the lab and they treat him like a baby.*


Red: It's up to me, huh?


*Cleetus is heard screaming*


Red: Cleetus? Alright, Watcher. Reveal yourself to me. I want to have a chat.


*The watcher appears.*


The watcher : Hello there. My name is Kyle owner of Oakland. You can call me Kai. I see you have a question of how I run this town… AND THE WORLD!


Red: What have you done to Cleetus?


The Watcher: Oh nothing. 


Red: TELL ME.


The watcher : Let's just say he's all tied up.


Red: STOP THIS AT ONCE.


The Watcher : Oh little Reddie, Soon you'll be just like everyone else. A child.


Red: NO.


The Watcher : Oh? Wanna fight for Oakland now? I'm stronger than everyone in this town. I can easily defeat you…


Red: Let's Play a game….


The Watcher : What kind of game?


Red: Oh you'll see… *Epic fighting montage*
                          
*Red fights the watcher. Red is able to easily kill the watcher.*


*The watcher is at 1% health*


Red: Now… Prepare to… DiEeEeEeEeEeEe…


*Red kills the watcher*


*The borders disappear. The magic hands let go of everyone.*


*Everyone is free to leave.*


*Luke leaves Oakland.*


Luke: I'M FREEEEEEEEEEE! 


*All the ghost people rise from the grave and start chasing Troy out of Oakland.*


*Troy is officially in a new town. Luke is in a new town. Red stays in Oakland with Cleetus. All seems well.*




















*The watcher comes back to life.*


The watcher : Hahaha… that was my clone! You really think you could defeat me?


*The watcher brings everyone back to Oakland and puts the border back over Oakland.*


Luke: GRRRRRRRRRRRR! 


The Watcher : Sorry Red but… *Kicks Red out of Oakland and puts a metal forcefield over Oakland.*


Luke: AHHHHH! WE ARE ALL HOPELESS! EVERYONE, RUN!!!!!


*Troy drinks his Strawberry milk and looks at the watcher. He just stares at the watcher.*


The watcher : Hello Troy! What are you doing? 


Troy: Drinking my Strawberry milk!


The watcher : Well what if I gave you an unlimited supply of this stuff? All you gotta do is convince your friends to drink it and make sure to do what the magic hands do then you can have all the Strawberry milk you want!


Troy: So I just do what I do to Sam but i do it to everyone?


The watcher : Yes.


Troy: Okie! *I notice Luke and I run up to him.*


Troy: *Grabs Luke and force feeds him Strawberry milk then hugs him.* Hey Lukie!


Luke: *Tries to force Troy off of me but Troy doesn't stop. Starts to become sleepy and starts to become like Troy.* 


Troy: Aww! Now onto my other fwiends!


*Troy turns everyone into a Troy and the watcher puts hypnosis helmets on everyone.*


The watcher : Repeat after me. I will not be evil. I will do what the watcher tells me to do.


*Meanwhile with Red.*


Red: *Tries to get in.* WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE PEOPLE IN THERE?


*Red sees everyone brainwashed.*


Red: What the- What the heck is happening?


The watcher : *Teleports Red into Oakland.* I'm glad you asked! I just made everyone like Troy!


Red: YOU BRAINWASHED AND HYPNOTIZED THESE… KIDS?


The watcher : I'm only protecting them…


Red: STOP BRAINWASHING THEM!


*To be continued…*


Narrator: Welcome to the newest Story Series episode.


Let's begin.


*In Oakland, There lives one boy who goes by the name of Duke. Duke was a child just like everyone else in Oakland but Duke had one fear. Angels! Everytime Duke saw a angel, Duke would scream and panic kinda like Troy except Duke was fearful of Angels only. Let's see how our story goes.*


*Let's begin.*


Duke: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Sees my pa.*


Duke: Hi Pa. 


Duke's pa: Howdy, Duke! 


*Duke eats breakfast.*


Duke: I'm going to see Orbis. Is that ok?


Duke's pa: Yeah. I don't mind.


*Duke goes to Orbis.*


Duke's pa: Now I'm alone…


Ghost : No you aren't! 


Duke's pa: AH- Oh. Hello.


Ghost: My name is Trista!


Duke's pa: You are such a cute ghost! Wanna go move to the Bahamas and spend some time together?


Ghost: What about the kid?


Duke's pa: Sophie can take care of him.


Ghost: Works for me!


*Duke's pa and the ghost move to the Bahamas.*


*Meanwhile with Duke.*


*Duke is now at Orbis's palace.*


Duke: Hey Orbis. 


Orbis: Hello Duke. What can I do for you?


Duke: Can I have a tour of Soapbar's lab?


Orbis: Yes you can. Is your dad around?


Duke: He left me for a ghost.


Orbis: Oh! So sad! Let me take you to Elese and she'll take care of you.


Duke: Okay!


*Orbis walks Duke to Elese's lab.*


*Orbis knocks on Elese's door to her lab.*


*Elese answers the door.*


Orbis: Hello Elese! This is a kid without a parent called Duke.


Elese: Aww! He's so cute! I think he'll be perfect here.


Orbis: Alright. Well, I'm going back to my place, Take care of Elese for me!


Elese: Ok!


Orbis: *Goes back to my place.*


Elese: Come on in, Duke!


*Duke comes in his house.*


Elese: Do you need anything, Duke?


Duke: No.


Elese: You look a bit tired, Duke. Are you okay?


Duke: Yeah. I haven't really slept much.


Elese: Why can't you sleep?


Duke: That is personal information I cannot disclose to you.


Elese: I understand. You don't have to tell me. I still do want you to sleep though.


Duke: But I don't want to sleep.


Elese: I have the perfect place for you to sleep.


Duke: Please not the basement..


Elese: NO! NEVER!  You are going to a comfortable sleeping room!


Duke: O-Okay. 


*Elese takes Duke to a bedroom with a child Duke's age sleeping. Elese puts Duke next to the child.*


Elese: Hug the child.


Duke: Why?


Elese: The child is sad and I think you'll feel good when you hug him. *Turns off the lights and tucks Duke in. Makes Duke hug the child gently and closes the bedroom door.*


Duke: *Falls asleep and starts to panic as I'm dreaming.*


*The other child wakes up and sees Duke hugging. The child feels better but the child sees Duke panicking so the other kid hugs Duke and goes back to sleep.*


Duke (Dreaming): AHH! WHERE AM I?


*The other kid appears in Duke's dream.*


Duke (Dreaming): SOMEBODY HELP ME!


*The other kid taps on Duke*


Kale (Other kid): Hey, You ok?


Duke: NO! I'M NOT OK! MY BIGGEST FEARS ARE ALL AROUND ME! PWEASE HELP ME!


*Kale hugs Duke gently*


Kale: Shhhh. You were the one who hugged me while I was asleep, Now I'm going to return the favor to you.


Duke: Please pwotect me…


Kale: *Continues hugging.* I will.


Duke: Thank you…


Kale: No problem.


*An angel flies over to Duke.*


Duke: *Screams*


*The angel tries to hug Duke.*


Duke: *Screams and wakes up.*


Kale: *Wakes up and looks at Duke.*


Duke: Hey.


Kale: I'm going to protect you.


Duke: Thank you. *Hugs and kisses kale.*


*Elese comes into the room .*


Elese: Hey Duke and Kale- AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! YOU TWO ARE SO ADORABLE!


Duke: I'm hungry!


Elese: Well, Let's eat!


Kale: What are we eating?


Elese: What do you cuties want to eat.


Kale: Idk. Surprise us.


Elese: Okay!


*Elese makes the food.*


*After she makes the food.*


Elese: Alright kids, Dig in! I made you cuties some breakfast!


*Duke and Kale eat*


*After they eat*


Kale: I’m full.


Duke: Me too.


Elese: Well kids, I was thinking that today we could go somewhere fun! I was thinking we could go to a different dimension!


Kale: Sounds fun!


Duke: I’m down.


Elese: Alright! Now if I could just find my portal gun then we could- *Sees my magic portal gun* Aha! Found it! *I open a portal to the wrong dimension and I try to close the portal. Duke gets sucked into the portal and the portal closes.*


Kale: Oh no! Duke got sucked into the portal! What do we do?


Elese: I think the portal gun is broken. I’m going to fix it then we need to open the portal. For now though, Just chill out.


*Meanwhile with Duke*


*Duke gets up. He is now in a dimension full of nice, gentle and friendly angels with powers! Duke won’t like that…*


*Duke looks around. Duke is terrified.*


*A angel flies down to Duke.*


Angey: Hello! My name is Angey! You must be a small human child! What’s your name, Child?


Duke: AHHHH! NO! MY NIGHTMARES ARE REAL!!!!! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Angey: Hey! Are you-


*Duke starts to cry.*


Angey: Woah! Please don’t cry! It’s ok! 


*All the angels see Duke crying and they fly over to Duke and hug him and play with him. The angels begin to comfort Duke and try to calm Duke down. Duke starts to turn red and Duke’s eyes go wide. The angels use their angel powers to do everything they can to help Duke but Duke is still mentally hurt.*


*One of the angels uses their mind healing powers to heal Duke’s mind. Duke starts to cry even more. The angels hug and cuddle Duke and they begin to cry with Duke. Duke realizes these angels are not a threat and Duke calms down. Duke is then introduced to angel city and the angels protect Duke. They teach Duke about their leader, God and how they praise him and worship him. The angels introduce Duke to worship music and the angels take care of Duke.*


*Meanwhile, Elese and Kale have fixed the portal gun and they go into the dimension. They enter into the angel dimension and the angels all welcome Kale and Elese. Duke runs to Kale and hugs him. The angels wave goodbye to Duke and the others and the angels resume their normal activity.*


*Duke has a good life*


*End of story*
Hey guys, Young Aaron here. Today we are going to be talking about how we can improve the Young Aaron personality. If you don't know what Young Aaron is, He is a young version of modern day Tick. Tick decided to revive his young self because he enjoys his younger self but he wants to change his younger self to be better. Young Aaron is the official mascot of the Tick YouTube channel and Tick has decided to make a series about it. By the way, The T.G.O.G series will continue. I am not ending it. I'm just thinking of new episode ideas. Now, Without further Ado, Let's begin today's Young Aaron research. This is the first time I am researching but I hope it goes well. So, Let's start our research.


Alright guys. So the first step to building a better Young me is to eliminate evil and replace it with good and nurture the kid with Compassion and kindness. That way, It'll make young Aaron less of an evil kid and more of a nicer kid! We also should eliminate bullying as bullying is not allowed on my channel. We also need to make sure Young Aaron's character is respectful, Kid-like and innocent but not hurtful or mean to others. We need to make sure Young Aaron can help others be Christian and that is do what I plan to do. I plan to make everyone better persons and Christians. Now that we got all the big important info out of the way, Let's talk about what videos I will be making! So I will be making some very respectful videos that teach people lessons. I will also be making some narrations, I'll be doing many different things just like Tick! I'll also be helping you guys out AND I'LL BE DOING LIVE STREAMS! IT'LL BE SO FUN! My streams will be very different from Tick's streams though. So, What other things will I be talking about in this research? Nothing. I've run out of ideas for this research. (WHY DO I PLAY AMERICAN IDOL? I DON'T WAAAAAANA PLAY IT ANYMORE DO LET'S HIDE IN THE OLD DAYS AND PLAY AMERICAN IDOL WHILE DRINKING A CUP OF GREEN TEA. This will be spoken in a very dramatic and deep funny voice.)

I  PRESENT  TO YOU the one the only made by me
IN THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By: AARON
What people need to know is that i think i could spend time with my friends in the future because they care about me. for exzample i went a abanded arcade place that has animatronics that still work, also i enjoy playing the arcade there, my friends are also nice to me, and we have fun exploring i went to the ambaned pizza place for exzample they have a old maskout chuck e cheese, and the animatronic band is 101 lbs. I had to call a tow truck that could lift it. I will have to call the tow truck tommrow.
Since the animatronics are still at the pizza place i maby[c] i could haul the animatronics to my house. But the problem is i can`t haul the animatronic band in my mom`s car. So i will have to call a tow truck to tow today it can just pick up the broken parts and tow it to my house. I have solved the problem. So if you ever want a animatronic band just go to a abanded pizza place that has animatronics that still work un plug the animatronic, then call a tow truck, finley wait till the tow truck comes to your house then you will have a animatronic band.  I hope you enjoyed my document bye bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   Red and romone adventures full story
So one day at reds redthebear was hm….. Let's see here i think he was… oh i remember! He was kissing roxy. Also another day at romones he was feeding clammy but than clammy broke the wall of jawbreaker. So meanwhile at reds, red was still kissing roxy when suddenly the phone rang. Red answered it and romone said something. “Hey red how ya do- but… this is not what the story is about… this is about the war of video games... all of the video games in the universe went into war…… so another day at reds red was panicking because of the war and he was smashing the walls and tipping over the ball pit and all of the balls slid down stairs and scattered all over the place “red why are you going crazy?” “OMG CAN'T YOU SEE? THERE IS A WAR OUT THERE!!!” so meanwhile in romones clammy could not stop eating romone and romone accidentally killed clammy and killed lamone in his romone pack “ romone, you gotta stop doing this!!!! You're trashing the palace and we have a low amount of survivors because of you!!!!” “ WELL TO BAD YOU GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF DUMB AND STUPID CANDY WEAKLINGS!!!!!!” meanwhile at reds again red has calmed down and apologised and now he is fixing the walls and ball pit. “ hey red i know it is rough out there and i know it made you panic.” “ well i was thinking... remember that time when i stopped that nuke? You helped me! and if we survived that we can survive anything so let's go out there and show them whos boss!!!!” “ ya let's go!” so they went into the war and killed tons of characters. Meanwhile at romones romone still was not calmed down yet. I WILL kill you romone pack  ha ha ha ha ha! Any last words?” “romone your crazy ‘gets a gun and clammy eats it. “ HAHAHAHA DIE *threw acid at the romone pack.”  yes i killed ramone because i blocked it and it bounced off at ramone HA HA i can't die BUT YOU CAN!!! DIE *clammy eats ramone pack* GOOD JOB CLAMMY SO YOUR NOT SO USELESS WHAT DID YOU SAY? Meanwhile at the war red and roxy were hiding from spring snap “ok maybe this was a bad idea was it roxy?” “yeah i guess… WAIT! You can use you're special powers together!!” “but how?” “believe.” “fine.” then red did his ultra power demon moves and said “may the black dove always carry you.” and all the video games got sucked back into their original games. Romone looked at the candy tv very bored and flipping through the channels, all of a sudden, the news flipped on and said “breaking news, the town of las vegas has been saved by redthebear once again!!” romone sighed as he said “i wish i could meet him, oh wait! I can I'LL JUST MAKE A PORTAL!!!” so he built a portal and turned it on waiting for red to go in it.

“The time I lied and regretted it...”
One exhausting summer day, Me, My mom Tatra, My sister Toti
and my sister’s friend Margy all met up and went to the park. My
mom Tatra said, “Now I am going to go for a walk with Margy’s
mom. Here are the rules... Rule 1. Don’t rough house or
anything. Rule 2. Do not leave the park unless we say you guys
can. Rule 3. Don’t go in the woods. Got it?” Then I said, “Yes
Mom. We got it.” Toti also said “Yes, we got it. We’ll follow the
rules...” Tatra, my mom said “Ok. Now you kids go do whatever
you kids do these days.” I said “Ok.” Then me and Toti went to
swing on the swings. 30 minutes later I decided to go see what
Margy was doing and Margy was on her cell phone googling
random things. A few minutes later, Margy decided to come to
us and she said this “ Hey guys. Wanna play tag?” I said sure.
Toti said “sure why not?” So we played tag for 1 hour and after
playing tag, Margy went to her original location and went on her
phone. Then Margy got off her cell phone and went to us, and
she asked both of us “Hey guys! Do you want to break a rule that
we aren’t supposed to break?” I said “Um. I don’t mean to be a
party pooper but... Don’t you think that is a bad idea? We might
get in trouble!” Margy said “Oh shut up! We won’t get caught if
we don’t tell them!” My sister Toti said “I’m down!” Margy said
“Come on Aaron! Let’s go to the woods! I promise they won’t find
out!” So I said “Ok as long as they don’t find out...” Oh but boy
was I wrong! So we went far into the woods that Tatra specifically
told us not to go into. Then after 40 minutes of playing in the
woods, We came out and Margy said “See? I told you our moms
won’t find out!” Tatra knew we were in the woods all along and
came up to us and said “Were you guys in those woods? I
thought I heard you guys there...” Margy said “this was all
Aaron’s idea! I had nothing to do with it!” Tatra said “You are in a
lot of trouble mister!” Then Margy’s mom took Margy home and
Tatra took us home. As soon as I came in the door of my house
Tatra said “I can’t believe you two would go in the woods! For
breaking my rules you both are grounded for one month!” I said “But Mom! I- I- I didn’t do it! It was Margy! Please! BELIEVE
ME!!!!” Tatra said “I have heard enough YOU ARE
GROUNDED!!!!” As I went into my room, I planned to prove my
innocence. So I came up with a plan. One month later when I got
ungrounded, We went to the park again but this time i got my
phone. So Margy went into the woods and she started bragging
about how she wasn’t going to be in trouble and that I was. The
whole time she said that, I was recording her. So after she
stopped bragging she said “What are you doing?” I said “Um...
Nothing?” I ran to Tatra and explained to her what happened, and
I showed Margy’s mom the video. Margy ran up to my mom and
said “Mrs. Tatra! It wasn’t me! I was framed!”
Her mom came up to her and said “It wasn’t you? Then why does
that video show proof? Are you lying?” Margy said “No! I was
framed!” Margy’s mom said “YOU FRAMED AARON!!! When we
get home you are in a lot of trouble Missy...”
Margy’s mom dragged Margy home.
Margy got grounded. My mom said “I’m sorry for blaming you...
you are a good kid and you’d never do this.” I said “It’s ok mom. I
understand. Margy’s mom called Tatra and apologized. Margy
got disciplined. Margy never went into those woods again.

*There was a boy who was 13. There was also a girl who was 10. These two kids lived together. The boy would always get teased by the girl. One day, The boy became silent. He would avoid the girl completely. The boy was named Kyle and the girl was named Cecilia. Let's see what happens next!


*Present day*


Cecila: *Wakes up and goes downstairs. Tries to find Kyle. I can't find him. I notice a note at the front door. It's from Kyle.* A note? Not again… Probably ANOTHER STUPID NOTE ABOUT WORK OR HOW HE'S "Sorry"... WHAT A PATHETIC DISGUSTING BROTHER I HAVE.


*The note reads "Hello, Ceceila. If you are reading this, Well, I'm leaving. I'm going to do what you told me to do! Jump off a bridge and die! I'm going to never be around you again. I'm going to leave. You'll never see me again. Goodbye forever."*


Cecila : I don't give a crap if he's dead!


*Meanwhile with Kyle.*


Kyle: Well, Time to die…


*Someone notices Kyle about to jump. The person grabs Kyle and hugs him.*


Samantha: Sir, Please tell me, Why did you want to jump?


Kyle: My family doesn't care about me.


Samantha: But you are so young! You have so much to learn.


Kyle: Nobody gives a care about me.


Samantha: Well I "give a" care about you.


Kyle: Really?


Samantha: Yeah. How about I take you to my house? It's pretty close by to where we are!


Kyle: O-Okay.


*Samantha takes Kyle to his house.*


Samantha: Well, Here we are?


Kyle: WE ARE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD! Are you my neighbor?


Samantha: I guess so?


Kyle: My family lives here…


Samantha: Don't worry. I'll protect you from your family.


Kyle: Thank you.


*A few days later.*


Kyle: Hey Samantha?


Samantha: Yeah?


Kyle: You know that one show called the story series?


Samantha: Mhm, What about it?


Kyle: Can we try to revive it?


Samantha: Well I happen to know the creator so yeah! 


Kyle: Ok!


*Meanwhile with Cecilia*


Cecila : I miss mom and dad… Now that Kyle is gone… I can't talk to anyone… I didn't mean to hurt him! I thought I was joking with him! Well, It's too late for me to apologize to Kyle since he's dead. *Cries* I miss Kyle!


*Cecila pulls herself together.*


Cecila : Maybe I'll go on a walk. That'll clear my head!


*Cecila walks out of her house. She decides to see what her neighbor is up to. Cecila knocks on the neighbor's door.*


Samantha: *Hears the knock.* Oh! I'll get it!


*Samantha answers the door. Kyle sees Cecilia and hides under his bed.*


Samantha: Hi! How can I help you, Neighbor?


Cecila : I want to talk about something…


Samantha: Have you been crying?


Cecila : Yeah. I miss my family…


Samantha: Come on in. I'll make you some Strawberry milk. Maybe my friend can cheer you up or something.


Cecila : That'd be nice.


*Cecila comes in Samantha's house and makes herself comfy.*


Samantha: I'll get you some Strawberry milk.


Cecila : Ok.


*Cecila looks around.* I really miss mom and dad…

Cecila : What. Take me to him!


Samantha: *Brings Cecilia into the guest bedroom.* He should be in here somewhere- *Sees Kyle under the bed and drags him out from under the bed.*


Kyle: *Tries to hold on but is lifted up and revealed to Cecilia.*


Cecila : It really is him… I thought he died!


Samantha: Huh? What do you mean?


*Kyle runs out the room.*


Cecila : Great. He ran out of the room. Well, That Kyle is my brother.


Samantha: He told me some things about you…


Cecila : I know. I've been awful to him but I decided to become nicer and I wanted to apologize to him.


Samantha: That's good. Maybe you can invite him for dinner at your house?


Cecila : He'll just run off when he sees me.


Samantha: Oh. Maybe I can keep him still?


Cecila: He'll be scarred for life if he sees me. He'll think we're bullying him.


Samantha: Can we both hug him then?

Samantha: PLEASE CALM DOWN!


Cecila : I don't think he likes this…


Samantha: This clearly isn't working. *Lets Kyle free.*


Kyle: *Runs off. Goes under my bed.*


Cecila : I think I may have one other solution to our problem.


Kyle: What is it?


Cecila : There was this old show that Kyle used to watch called The Story Series. It ended a week ago. Maybe if we revive it then we can get some answers from the characters on what to do.


Samantha: Ok. *Turns on a TV* No way… It says here that somebody already revived the story series! I think I have a idea. Ok so hear me out. If we can replicate Sophie's magic staff, Then we could travel to Oakland through a portal and have Sophie fix Kyle, and thus, We'd be featured on a Story Series show!


Cecila : But the author clearly says that it ended!
Samantha: Let's go pay the author a visit…


*Samantha goes to Aaron's house.*


Samantha: Excuse me, Is this where the author of the story series lives?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Why yes it is! The name's Aaron. Aaron. J. Hebbler. I'm the writer and producer of the story series.


Samantha: Why did you end the series?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: LD took over my series. He possessed the watcher and now everyone in Oakland is unsafe. Everyone in Oakland is going cookoo crazy and my series is dying. If only I could have some executive producer for my show.


Samantha: Why don't I help?


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Writing a story takes tons of work. You'd need hundreds of bottles of green tea and you'd need powerful music to be a able to write the stories that I write. Are you sure you want to do this?


Samantha: Teach me the way of the story series. Train me.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Ok. *Gets a carpet. Sets up the carpet and grabs some green tea bottles. Place 2 next to me and 2 on the other side of the carpet.* Sit down and drink your tea. Close your eyes and think of ideas.


Samantha: Ok. *Drinks green tea and thinks.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: Think about your idea and write. You are now trained in the art of Story Series.


Samantha: *Bows to Aaron* Thank you, Sensei Aaron.


Aaron. J. Hebbler: No prob. Now write the story with me! We are going to continue this series!


*Meanwhile in the story series world.*


Lord Conner (LD): HAHAHA! YOU FOOLS! I NOW RULE OAKLAND! YOU CAN'T STOP ME! SURRENDER TO ME! YOUR PRECIOUS WATCHER IS GONE… I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REALLY THOUGHT THE WATCHER BRAINWASHED YOU! BY KILLING HIM, YOU DESTROYED THIS BORDER AND NOW, I CAN FINALLY KILL EVERYONE IN THE WORLD- *Cage appears and locks Lord Conner in. The watcher comes out of the ground and is angry at LD.*


The Watcher : Haha! I am revived! Thanks Aaron!


Aaron (Story series version): No prob!


The watcher : NOBODY ENSLAVES MY PEOPLE! *Rebuilds the border and rebuilds the buildings. Rebuilds everything. Restores Oakland and its compassionate people. Revives Orbis and all the Oakland laws. Puts Red back in Cincinnati and turns Lord Conner into a child. Puts Lord Conner in a maximum security mental health hospital. Removes all the evilness and replaces it with good in every evil character. Revives everything magic. Restores Oakland completely. Restores the USB and magic book. Restores Elese and all the older characters. Removes the glitches and bugs. Revives everything good and fixes everything.* Oakland is restored! Now my people, Have fun again and don't fall for Lord Conner's brainwashings. I never brainwashed anyone. Now go on, Have some fun all my children who are all children! You will no longer be hurt and its thanks to God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit and for Aaron. Thank you very much and goodnight, Oakland!


*It is now night in Oakland and all the children go to sleep.*


The watcher : *Watches over my mighty town. The protection of God is over this town.* Ah, What a great day. I'll go take care of Red later…


*We now go back to the other universe with Kyle and his friends and family.*


Aaron. J. Hebbler: We did it! We saved Oakland! Now there can be a 5th generation of the story series! Thank you, Samantha! To show you my gratitude, I will make you a portal to Oakland where you shall live and be happy with all your friends and family. You shall be a child and live in peace and harmony.

Kyle: Mhm.


Troy: Same.


*A magic hand is holding a flashlight. It hears a noise so it goes out of Sophie's room and goes down to the kitchen. The hand notices Kyle and Troy awake and the hand gets a Strawberry milk bottle.*


Troy: RUN!


Kyle: WHAT IS THAT THING?


Troy: It's Sophie's magic hands. They are making sure we have a good sleep and they make sure we are healthy. The hands think that we freak out that we are not healthy and happy do they feed us strawberry milk so we don't cry. They are really good but they kinda scare me. The hands are playing with us right now so we should probably run. You don't want the hands to make you laugh. Once they play, They make sure you are happy. I'm okay with it but i don't like it when the hands pet my head because it makes me cry but i love it when I am fed strawberry milk and healed.


Kyle: AH! I DON'T LIKE IT!


Troy: I'll protect you. *Hugs and holds onto Kyle gently. Making sure magic hands don't make Kyle scared.*


*The magic hand tries to touch Kyle.*


Troy: NO. MAGIC HAND, NO. KYLE IS NEW TO THIS. HE IS ACTUALLY SCARED OF YOU. PLEASE DON'T PLAY WITH HIM.


*The magic hand does a thumbs up and makes a special bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle and makes a normal strawberry milk bottle for Troy. The magic hand feeds the strawberry milk bottle to Troy and Troy grabs the bottle of Strawberry milk for Kyle.*


Troy: I can feed the bottle to Kyle.


*The magic hand goes to the back of the room and watches.*


Troy: The magic hand is not near us anymore. Let me feed the strawberry milk to you and we'll cuddle and sleep next to each other. I'll protect you.


Kyle: Okie. 


*Kyle drinks the Strawberry milk and falls asleep. Troy also falls asleep and holds onto Kyle and hugs him. Kyle coos and Troy coos. The magic hand cleans up the magic strawberry milk bottle mess and puts a blanket over Troy and Kyle. The hand pars Troy and goes upstairs to the magic hands room and goes to sleep next to the other magic hands.*


*The next morning.*


Sophie : *Goes to the kitchen with the magic hands.* Aww! It looks like Kyle and Troy got along! Come on magic hands, Go eat your magic strawberry milk dust. I'm going to wake up Kyle and Troy.


Sophie : *Takes the blanket off Troy. Begins to hug Troy.*


Troy: *Wakes up and smiles* Hey Sophie!


Sophie : Hey Troy! Did you have a good sleep?


Troy: Yeah!


*Sophie is about to playfully wake up Kyle as well.*


Troy: Sophie. Remember the kid that became depressed when you played with him? You know how he hated it when you played with him?


Sophie : Yeah?


Troy: Do you want Kyle to have a heart attack? Kyle doesn't like being playfully waken up and he doesn't like playful people so please, Let me wake him up.


Sophie : Sorry. I didn't know that Kyle wasn't a playful kid. I'll let you wake him up.


*Troy hugs and holds and cuddles Kyle and wakes Kyle up.*


Kyle: *Wakes up and hugs Troy. Cries from a nightmare.*


Troy: *Feeds Strawberry milk to Kyle.* Shh, Shh. It's okay. What's wrong?

She builds some sort of resurrection machine and is somehow able to revive Troy, only now he has no memories of anything or anyone in Oakland.


Troy: Where am i? Who are you? WHO AM I?


Sophie: Troy? Don't you remember me?


Troy: No. Who are you and who am I?


Sophie: DON'T YOU REMEMBER OAKLAND? THE MAGIC HANDS? THE STRAWBERRY MILK? DON'T YOU REMEMBER ALL THE ROBOTS?


Troy: No. What are you talking about? 


Sophie: Your name is Troy and you live in a magic world called Oakland!


Troy: My name is Troy? What do I do?


Sophie: Well, You like to cry and scream. You annoy everyone. You are scared of everything.


Troy: That sounds lame. I think I'd be more of a dog.


Sophie: YOU ARE NOT A DOG!


Troy: Woof woof. 


Mark: Does Troy have amnesia? 


Sophie: Yes. He thinks he's a dog.


Mark: Oh I know how to handle this. Ok Troy. So you are a dog and you are named Petie.


Troy: Yay! My name is Petie. So. What do I do?


Mark: You like pacifiers and drinking milk. You also like sleeping.


Troy: O.. Kay? I don't feel like I do that.


Mark: Trust me. You do.


Sophie: MARK! STOP PLAYING AROUND! TROY IS NOT A DOG! TROY ISN'T A PETIE. TELL TROY THE TRUTH.


*Red appears*


Sophie: Red? What are you doing here? I thought you moved out of Ohio?


Red: I did but I sensed that Troy was still alive.


Sophie: Yes, Yes. Troy is alive but he has no memories of anything. For some reason, Troy still looks like he's 13 even though he's 20.


Red: Probably because people look younger in this town.


Sophie: Oh.


Troy: Wow. That's a big ol bear! 


Red: Um. Actually. For your information I'm a-

Tick: MY NAME…. NOT TUCKY!


Sophie: I'm coming to your room! *Runs to Tick's room and opens the door.*


Tick: No! Don't go in there! I'm warning you!


*Sophie opens the door of Tick's room and her eyes open wide. Sophie sees a room full of androids that are painted to look like certain characters.*


Sophie: WHAT THE HECK IS THIS? 


Tick: I may or may not have killed Troy a long time ago?


Sophie: This whole time I'VE BEEN WITH AN ANDROID? HOW LONG WAS TROY DEAD FOR?


Tick: 32 years.


Sophie: WHAT? WHEN DID HE DIE?


Tick: Sometime in the 90s.


Sophie: …

Sophie: I'm so lost, Tick.


Tick: I'm… Not even alive.


Sophie: What? What the heck do you mean?


Tick: I'm a Android.


Sophie: IS EVERYONE AN ANDROID? AHHHHHHHHH!




*Sophie wakes up in her room and panics. She looks around and calms down. Sophie sees Troy sleeping in the corner with a bottle of Strawberry milk in his hands.*


Sophie: So Troy never died? Oh wow. What a crazy dream. What time is it? *Looks at my watch.* Oh. It's only 7 am. I'm going to get up and wake Troy up.


*Sophie gets up and drinks some wake up Strawberry milk. Sophie then gives Troy some wake up Strawberry milk and Troy wakes up.*


Troy: Morning, Sophie.


Sophie: Hey Troy.


Troy: What time is it?


Sophie: 7.


Troy: What are we doing today?


Sophie: I dunno. 


Troy: Can I go sleep with my amor?


Sophie: Your love? 


Troy: Yes.


Sophie: Ok just don't do any weird stuff around anyone.


Troy: Okie.


*Sophie Goes downstairs and she cooks some breakfast. Sophie decides to go to the pet store to buy a pet.*


*Sophie gets a pet and goes back home.*


Sophie: I think I'm going to name you Petie.


*Troy comes out of Sam's room and sees the dog. Troy grabs a pacifier and some Strawberry milk and starts running towards the dog.*


Sophie: TROY WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PETIE?


*Troy gives Petie the Strawberry milk and puts the pacifier in Petie's mouth.*


Sophie: TROY! YOU TURNED PETIE INTO A TROY!


Troy: I'm naming you Troy JR.


Petie: Woof! 


Troy: Hey Petie! You want some chicken sauce?


Petie: Bleh!🤮


Troy: Strawberry milk?


Petie: Woof! 😄


Troy: Good Troy JR.


*We now go to Romone and Red.*


*Romone Wakes up and knocks on Red's door.*


*Red answers the door.*


Red: What is it?


Romone: Uhh. Something SUSSY is going on in the lab and I need help.


Red: Ok.


*Romone takes Red to the lab.*


Red: So what's going on?


Romone: Look at Sophie.


Red: Uh. Why is there a dog that is being treated like a Troy?


Romone: Um. I don't know.


Red: Well I'm going to stop it.


Red: *Goes to Sophie.*


Sophie: Hi Red! What are you and Romone doing here?


Romone: What are you doing to that poor dog?


Sophie: I'm just treating it like I treat Troy!


Romone: Let go of the dog.


Sophie: NO.


Red: *Grabs Petie from Sophie and takes the pacifier and strawberry milk bottle out of the dog's mouth.*


*The dog starts crying like a Troy.*


Petie: WOOOOOOOOOOF!


Red: What… Did you do to the dog?


Romone: She turned it into a Troy.


Sophie: Give me the dog back!


Romone: No. I'm going to take care of Petite since you can't do it.


Sophie: The dog is gonna die from sugar if he lives with you!


Romone: I have special candy for dogs. He'll be completely fine.


Sophie: Then if I can't have a pet then… I'm going to turn everyone into a Troy…


*Sophie kicks Red and Romone out of her lab and she locks the door. Sophie sees Tick and Troy eating. Sophie looks at Tick with delight.*


Sophie: Hehehe. *Sneaks behind Tick and waits for him to finish eating. Then I snatch Tick.*


Troy: Sophie, What are you doing to Tick?


Sophie: Tick is gonna be my pet!


Troy: Oh no no no! You've already done this.


Sophie: IF I CAN'T TURN ANYONE INTO A PET, THEN I'M GOING TO MAKE EVERYONE A CHILD FOREVER. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO AGE AND YOU'LL ALL BE FED STRAWBERRY MILK. YOU'LL ALL BE MY PETS! MUHAHAHA!


*Sophie Goes to Orbis's palace and she tries to beat up Orbis but Orbis turns Sophie into a permanent child.*
 
Sophie: HEY! WHAT THE HECK?


Orbis: You never learn, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO KILL YOU AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE!


Orbis: No you ain't. I'm much stronger than you. I'm the second strongest entity in this town. If you kill me then you kill everyone in this world. I'm not letting you destroy this town with your evil ways, Sophie.


Sophie: I'M GOING TO KILL Y-


Orbis: Shut up. *puts Sophie to sleep.*


Sophie: N- 


Orbis: That takes care of that.


*Orbis goes to the lab and sees what's going on.*


Orbis: Hey. Um. I don't know why Sophie is going crazy again but uh. I guess I'm going to take over this lab since Sophie is crazy and she is mentally unstable.


Tick: No more being called Tucky?


Orbis: No. You are still Tucky.


Tick: You should know I hate being called Tucky.


Orbis: It's funny.


Tick: GRRRR. MY NAME IS NOT TUCKY!


Orbis: Alright I'll note to call you Tucky.


Tick: I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU!


Orbis: Go ahead and see what happens.


*Tick tries to punch Orbis but he ends up going right through Orbis.*


Orbis: I love annoying Tick. *Teleports in front of Tick* You gotta catch me, Tucky!


Tick: STAND STILL!


Orbis: *Teleports behind Tick.* You are funny. I like annoying you.


*After Orbis annoys Tick for 10 minutes.*


Orbis: Ok guys. What do you kids want to eat?


Troy: Strawberry milk!


Orbis: No. You can't eat that!


Troy: I want it! Give me Strawberry milk!


Orbis: Ok. If that's what you want then ok. *Makes Troy a bottle of Strawberry milk.* There you go.


*Troy drinks the strawberry milk and starts to cry and scream.*


Orbis: Troy, Go to your room.


Troy: Ok! *Goes to me and Sam's room.*


Orbis: Ok Tick. What do you want to eat?


Tick (Pissed off): I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO I WANT? *Stares at Orbis' eyes.*


Orbis: I'm guessing you are still mad at me. I'm just gonna make you some Mac n cheese.*


Tick: *Gasps* MAC AND CHEESE? YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!


Orbis: Why does everyone just scream in my town? This town makes no sense.


Red: I know.


Orbis: Oh. Hi Red. I don't know how I didn't notice you. Anyways, Back to cooking!


*Orbis makes some Mac and cheese for Tick.*


Orbis: Here you go. 


Tick: *Wolfs down the entire batch of Mac and cheese.* Thanks. *Runs back to my room with my Nintendo switch.*


Orbis: Now Luke, What do you want to eat?


Luke: I am not hungry.


Orbis: I can see through your stomach. You are hungry. Now eat.


Luke: Wait. What now?


Orbis: I can see through your stomach.


Luke: NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Orbis: No I'm not getting away from you. You need to eat. Now don't act like a Troy now…


Luke: Don't act like a Troy? Don't you call me a Troy!


Orbis: I can call you whatever you want.


Luke: Oh really? Wanna fight?


Orbis: I don't fight my fellow citizens.


Luke: FIGHT ME.


Orbis: No. 


Luke: BEAT ME.


Orbis: No.


*Red looks at Luke*


Red: You remind me of Troy except you don't spray Strawberry milk on me and run around my pizzeria.


Luke: *Starts to throw a temper tantrum.*


Orbis: Stop it Luke. Don't make me do it…


*Luke doesn't stop.*


*Luke screams as Orbis scares Luke off.*


*Luke runs out of Ohio and runs to Louisiana. Red takes him there.*


Luke: Thanks Red.


*Red flies back to ohio.*


Luke: *I am angry at everyone.*


Young Aaron: IN LOUISIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA!


Luke: GRRR. SHUT UP. YOU ARE ANNOYING ME.


Young Aaron: Waaw! Why ywou mwean?


Luke: Sorry. I'm just angry at people.


Young Aaron: Oh. Iwt owk.


There is a strange force that flings Luke back. When he gets up young Aaron is nowhere to be found.


One week later…


Oakland has been pretty boring ever since Sophie disappeared and orbis took over.


*Luke wakes up in the enchanted magic forest and sees magic hands surrounding him.*


Luke: NO. I CAN'T BE HERE! AHHHHH! *Runs to Red's pizza.*


Luke: RED. I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE!


*Red answers the door.*


Red: How did you get back here from Louisiana?


Luke: I DON'T KNOW BUT I NEED HELP DESTROYING OAKLAND BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! I CAN'T TAKE THIS CONSTANT REPETITIVE LIFE. PLEASE STOP THIS TORTURE!


Red: You want to destroy Oakland and get rid of the magic and weirdness?


Luke: YES. PLEASE END THIS NEVER ENDING TORTURE!


Red: Ok. I'll help. But we need to come up with a plan…


*Epic plan making montage.*


Luke: Alright. Explain the plan to me again?


Red: Ok so we need to get rid of Orbis and Oakland's power. Since you are good at hacking you can distract Orbis while I kill him and destroy his power of Oakland.


Luke: Ok. Let's do this.


*We now enter Red's pov*


Red: *Goes to Orbis's palace and sneaks in.*


*Orbis is watching Young Aaron.*


*Orbis doesn't notice Red.*


*Red snaps Orbis's neck and eats Orbis. Red then nukes Orbis's palace and powerplant.*


*Luke runs away from the explosion and meets Red at Soapbar's palace.*


Luke: I guess this is goodbye. Nah. JUST BLOW EVERYTHING UP!


Red: If you say so. Get on my back. I'll fly to safety.


Luke: K.


*Red flies Luke to safety. Luke watches Oakland get destroyed. Kurtis and Cleetus are with Luke. Romone and the Romanians+ King Aaron are also with Luke.*


*Red blows up Oakland.*


*A weird phenomenon happens where it seems that oakland reverts back to normal in a blink of an eye. It seems that there is something that prevents Oakland's destruction, but what could it be? Everyone is suddenly teleported back to Oakland and some strange border forms around the city. Everyone blacks out and their memories of this day happening were wiped. They all wake up back to where they were originally.* 
Luke: *wakes up* huh.. What a weird dream. Wait a second… THAT WAS REAL! SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BRAINWASH ME! 


*Luke goes to Red's.*


Luke: RED! I NEED YOUR HELP! 


Red: I know. Oakland got resetted again.


Luke: HOW ARE YOU NOT AFFECTED?


Red: I'm a robot. I can't be affected by Oakland.


Luke: WHY DOESN'T THIS NIGHTMARE END???


Red: The only way to end this is to find the source…


Luke: Hmm. Maybe we can catch the thing that resets Oakland.


Red: And since the technology can't be affected, Maybe we could record the reset and see what is causing this.


Luke: Wow. That's actually not a bad idea!


Red: I've seen this happen many times… Where is Cleetus and the others?


Luke: Well, I don't know. Last time I saw them was when we were out of Oakland.


Red: So it seems like something is watching whatever the people do… Almost like a TV show where the director watches everything.


Luke: But this isn't a show. This is reality.


Red: We need to focus on the plan. Let's stop breaking the 4th wall.


Luke: K. So let's get a camera and you record the action since you can't be affected.


*Red gets a camera from somewhere and records Oakland.*


*Luke walks out of the border of Oakland and Oakland resets. Red caught the action on tape.*


Red: I got the recording- Oh right. Everytime Oakland resets, Every living thing is teleported back to the lab and/or their house.


*Luke runs out the lab. Magic hands chase him.*


Luke: RED! I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU. THE WATCHER. THAT'S THE GUY WHO IS CONTROLLING THIS. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS- IT'S UP TO YOU TO SAVE THE WORLD. 


*The magic hands take Luke back to the lab and they treat him like a baby.*


Red: It's up to me, huh?


*Cleetus is heard screaming*


Red: Cleetus? Alright, Watcher. Reveal yourself to me. I want to have a chat.


*The watcher appears.*


The watcher : Hello there. My name is Kyle owner of Oakland. You can call me Kai. I see you have a question of how I run this town… AND THE WORLD!


Red: What have you done to Cleetus?


The Watcher: Oh nothing. 


Red: TELL ME.


The watcher : Let's just say he's all tied up.


Red: STOP THIS AT ONCE.


The Watcher : Oh little Reddie, Soon you'll be just like everyone else. A child.


Red: NO.


The Watcher : Oh? Wanna fight for Oakland now? I'm stronger than everyone in this town. I can easily defeat you…


Red: Let's Play a game….


The Watcher : What kind of game?


Red: Oh you'll see… *Epic fighting montage*
                          
*Red fights the watcher. Red is able to easily kill the watcher.*


*The watcher is at 1% health*


Red: Now… Prepare to… DiEeEeEeEeEeEe…


*Red kills the watcher*


*The borders disappear. The magic hands let go of everyone.*


*Everyone is free to leave.*


*Luke leaves Oakland.*


Luke: I'M FREEEEEEEEEEE! 


*All the ghost people rise from the grave and start chasing Troy out of Oakland.*


*Troy is officially in a new town. Luke is in a new town. Red stays in Oakland with Cleetus. All seems well.*




















*The watcher comes back to life.*


The watcher : Hahaha… that was my clone! You really think you could defeat me?


*The watcher brings everyone back to Oakland and puts the border back over Oakland.*


Luke: GRRRRRRRRRRRR! 


The Watcher : Sorry Red but… *Kicks Red out of Oakland and puts a metal forcefield over Oakland.*


Luke: AHHHHH! WE ARE ALL HOPELESS! EVERYONE, RUN!!!!!


*Troy drinks his Strawberry milk and looks at the watcher. He just stares at the watcher.*


The watcher : Hello Troy! What are you doing? 


Troy: Drinking my Strawberry milk!


The watcher : Well what if I gave you an unlimited supply of this stuff? All you gotta do is convince your friends to drink it and make sure to do what the magic hands do then you can have all the Strawberry milk you want!


Troy: So I just do what I do to Sam but i do it to everyone?


The watcher : Yes.


Troy: Okie! *I notice Luke and I run up to him.*


Troy: *Grabs Luke and force feeds him Strawberry milk then hugs him.* Hey Lukie!


Luke: *Tries to force Troy off of me but Troy doesn't stop. Starts to become sleepy and starts to become like Troy.* 


Troy: Aww! Now onto my other fwiends!


*Troy turns everyone into a Troy and the watcher puts hypnosis helmets on everyone.*


The watcher : Repeat after me. I will not be evil. I will do what the watcher tells me to do.


*Meanwhile with Red.*


Red: *Tries to get in.* WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE PEOPLE IN THERE?


*Red sees everyone brainwashed.*


Red: What the- What the heck is happening?


The watcher : *Teleports Red into Oakland.* I'm glad you asked! I just made everyone like Troy!


Red: YOU BRAINWASHED AND HYPNOTIZED THESE… KIDS?


The watcher : I'm only protecting them…


Red: STOP BRAINWASHING THEM!


*To be continued…*


Narrator: Welcome to the newest Story Series episode.


Let's begin.


*In Oakland, There lives one boy who goes by the name of Duke. Duke was a child just like everyone else in Oakland but Duke had one fear. Angels! Everytime Duke saw a angel, Duke would scream and panic kinda like Troy except Duke was fearful of Angels only. Let's see how our story goes.*

Elese: Come on in, Duke!


*Duke comes in his house.*


Elese: Do you need anything, Duke?


Duke: No.


Elese: You look a bit tired, Duke. Are you okay?


Duke: Yeah. I haven't really slept much.


Elese: Why can't you sleep?


Duke: That is personal information I cannot disclose to you.


Elese: I understand. You don't have to tell me. I still do want you to sleep though.


Duke: But I don't want to sleep.


Elese: I have the perfect place for you to sleep.


Duke: Please not the basement..


Elese: NO! NEVER!  You are going to a comfortable sleeping room!


Duke: O-Okay. 


*Elese takes Duke to a bedroom with a child Duke's age sleeping. Elese puts Duke next to the child.*


Elese: Hug the child.


Duke: Why?


Elese: The child is sad and I think you'll feel good when you hug him. *Turns off the lights and tucks Duke in. Makes Duke hug the child gently and closes the bedroom door.*


Duke: *Falls asleep and starts to panic as I'm dreaming.*


*The other child wakes up and sees Duke hugging. The child feels better but the child sees Duke panicking so the other kid hugs Duke and goes back to sleep.*


Duke (Dreaming): AHH! WHERE AM I?


*The other kid appears in Duke's dream.*


Duke (Dreaming): SOMEBODY HELP ME!

Elese: Alright kids, Dig in! I made you cuties some breakfast!


*Duke and Kale eat*


*After they eat*


Kale: I’m full.


Duke: Me too.


Elese: Well kids, I was thinking that today we could go somewhere fun! I was thinking we could go to a different dimension!


Kale: Sounds fun!


Duke: I’m down.


Elese: Alright! Now if I could just find my portal gun then we could- *Sees my magic portal gun* Aha! Found it! *I open a portal to the wrong dimension and I try to close the portal. Duke gets sucked into the portal and the portal closes.*


Kale: Oh no! Duke got sucked into the portal! What do we do?


Elese: I think the portal gun is broken. I’m going to fix it then we need to open the portal. For now though, Just chill out.


*Meanwhile with Duke*


*Duke gets up. He is now in a dimension full of nice, gentle and friendly angels with powers! Duke won’t like that…*


*Duke looks around. Duke is terrified.*


*A angel flies down to Duke.*


Angey: Hello! My name is Angey! You must be a small human child! What’s your name, Child?


Duke: AHHHH! NO! MY NIGHTMARES ARE REAL!!!!! GET AWAY FROM ME!


Angey: Hey! Are you-


*Duke starts to cry.*


Angey: Woah! Please don’t cry! It’s ok! 


*All the angels see Duke crying and they fly over to Duke and hug him and play with him. The angels begin to comfort Duke and try to calm Duke down. Duke starts to turn red and Duke’s eyes go wide. The angels use their angel powers to do everything they can to help Duke but Duke is still mentally hurt.*


*One of the angels uses their mind healing powers to heal Duke’s mind. Duke starts to cry even more. The angels hug and cuddle Duke and they begin to cry with Duke. Duke realizes these angels are not a threat and Duke calms down. Duke is then introduced to angel city and the angels protect Duke. They teach Duke about their leader, God and how they praise him and worship him. The angels introduce Duke to worship music and the angels take care of Duke.*


*Meanwhile, Elese and Kale have fixed the portal gun and they go into the dimension. They enter into the angel dimension and the angels all welcome Kale and Elese. Duke runs to Kale and hugs him. The angels wave goodbye to Duke and the others and the angels resume their normal activity.*


*Duke has a good life*


*End of story*
Hey guys, Young Aaron here. Today we are going to be talking about how we can improve the Young Aaron personality. If you don't know what Young Aaron is, He is a young version of modern day Tick. Tick decided to revive his young self because he enjoys his younger self but he wants to change his younger self to be better. Young Aaron is the official mascot of the Tick YouTube channel and Tick has decided to make a series about it. By the way, The T.G.O.G series will continue. I am not ending it. I'm just thinking of new episode ideas. Now, Without further Ado, Let's begin today's Young Aaron research. This is the first time I am researching but I hope it goes well. So, Let's start our research.


Alright guys. So the first step to building a better Young me is to eliminate evil and replace it with good and nurture the kid with Compassion and kindness. That way, It'll make young Aaron less of an evil kid and more of a nicer kid! We also should eliminate bullying as bullying is not allowed on my channel. We also need to make sure Young Aaron's character is respectful, Kid-like and innocent but not hurtful or mean to others. We need to make sure Young Aaron can help others be Christian and that is do what I plan to do. I plan to make everyone better persons and Christians. Now that we got all the big important info out of the way, Let's talk about what videos I will be making! So I will be making some very respectful videos that teach people lessons. I will also be making some narrations, I'll be doing many different things just like Tick! I'll also be helping you guys out AND I'LL BE DOING LIVE STREAMS! IT'LL BE SO FUN! My streams will be very different from Tick's streams though. So, What other things will I be talking about in this research? Nothing. I've run out of ideas for this research. (WHY DO I PLAY AMERICAN IDOL? I DON'T WAAAAAANA PLAY IT ANYMORE DO LET'S HIDE IN THE OLD DAYS AND PLAY AMERICAN IDOL WHILE DRINKING A CUP OF GREEN TEA. This will be spoken in a very dramatic and deep funny voice.)

I  PRESENT  TO YOU the one the only made by me
IN THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By: AARON
What people need to know is that i think i could spend time with my friends in the future because they care about me. for exzample i went a abanded arcade place that has animatronics that still work, also i enjoy playing the arcade there, my friends are also nice to me, and we have fun exploring i went to the ambaned pizza place for exzample they have a old maskout chuck e cheese, and the animatronic band is 101 lbs. I had to call a tow truck that could lift it. I will have to call the tow truck tommrow.
Since the animatronics are still at the pizza place i maby[c] i could haul the animatronics to my house. But the problem is i can`t haul the animatronic band in my mom`s car. So i will have to call a tow truck to tow today it can just pick up the broken parts and tow it to my house. I have solved the problem. So if you ever want a animatronic band just go to a abanded pizza place that has animatronics that still work un plug the animatronic, then call a tow truck, finley wait till the tow truck comes to your house then you will have a animatronic band.  I hope you enjoyed my document bye bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So one day at reds redthebear was hm….. Let's see here i think he was… oh i remember! He was kissing roxy. Also another day at romones he was feeding clammy but than clammy broke the wall of jawbreaker. So meanwhile at reds, red was still kissing roxy when suddenly the phone rang. Red answered it and romone said something. “Hey red how ya do- but… this is not what the story is about… this is about the war of video games... all of the video games in the universe went into war…… so another day at reds red was panicking because of the war and he was smashing the walls and tipping over the ball pit and all of the balls slid down stairs and scattered all over the place “red why are you going crazy?” “OMG CAN'T YOU SEE? THERE IS A WAR OUT THERE!!!” so meanwhile in romones clammy could not stop eating romone and romone accidentally killed clammy and killed lamone in his romone pack “ romone, you gotta stop doing this!!!! You're trashing the palace and we have a low amount of survivors because of you!!!!” “ WELL TO BAD YOU GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF DUMB AND STUPID CANDY WEAKLINGS!!!!!!” meanwhile at reds again red has calmed down and apologised and now he is fixing the walls and ball pit. “ hey red i know it is rough out there and i know it made you panic.” “ well i was thinking... remember that time when i stopped that nuke? You helped me! and if we survived that we can survive anything so let's go out there and show them whos boss!!!!” “ ya let's go!” so they went into the war and killed tons of characters. Meanwhile at romones romone still was not calmed down yet. I WILL kill you romone pack  ha ha ha ha ha! Any last words?” “romone your crazy ‘gets a gun and clammy eats it. “ HAHAHAHA DIE *threw acid at the romone pack.”  yes i killed ramone because i blocked it and it bounced off at ramone HA HA i can't die BUT YOU CAN!!! DIE *clammy eats ramone pack* GOOD JOB CLAMMY SO YOUR NOT SO USELESS WHAT DID YOU SAY? Meanwhile at the war red and roxy were hiding from spring snap “ok maybe this was a bad idea was it roxy?” “yeah i guess… WAIT! You can use you're special powers together!!” “but how?” “believe.” “fine.” then red did his ultra power demon moves and said “may the black dove always carry you.” and all the video games got sucked back into their original games. Romone looked at the candy tv very bored and flipping through the channels, all of a sudden, the news flipped on and said “breaking news, the town of las vegas has been saved by redthebear once again!!” romone sighed as he said “i wish i could meet him, oh wait! I can I'LL JUST MAKE A PORTAL!!!” so he built a portal and turned it on waiting for red to go in it.

“The time I lied and regretted it...”
One exhausting summer day, Me, My mom Tatra, My sister Toti
and my sister’s friend Margy all met up and went to the park. My
mom Tatra said, “Now I am going to go for a walk with Margy’s
mom. Here are the rules... Rule 1. Don’t rough house or
anything. Rule 2. Do not leave the park unless we say you guys
can. Rule 3. Don’t go in the woods. Got it?” Then I said, “Yes
Mom. We got it.” Toti also said “Yes, we got it. We’ll follow the
rules...” Tatra, my mom said “Ok. Now you kids go do whatever
you kids do these days.” I said “Ok.” Then me and Toti went to
swing on the swings. 30 minutes later I decided to go see what
Margy was doing and Margy was on her cell phone googling
random things. A few minutes later, Margy decided to come to
us and she said this “ Hey guys. Wanna play tag?” I said sure.
Toti said “sure why not?” So we played tag for 1 hour and after
playing tag, Margy went to her original location and went on her
phone. Then Margy got off her cell phone and went to us, and
she asked both of us “Hey guys! Do you want to break a rule that
we aren’t supposed to break?” I said “Um. I don’t mean to be a
party pooper but... Don’t you think that is a bad idea? We might
get in trouble!” Margy said “Oh shut up! We won’t get caught if
we don’t tell them!” My sister Toti said “I’m down!” Margy said
“Come on Aaron! Let’s go to the woods! I promise they won’t find
out!” So I said “Ok as long as they don’t find out...” Oh but boy
was I wrong! So we went far into the woods that Tatra specifically
told us not to go into. Then after 40 minutes of playing in the
woods, We came out and Margy said “See? I told you our moms
won’t find out!” Tatra knew we were in the woods all along and
came up to us and said “Were you guys in those woods? I
thought I heard you guys there...” Margy said “this was all
Aaron’s idea! I had nothing to do with it!” Tatra said “You are in a
lot of trouble mister!” Then Margy’s mom took Margy home and
Tatra took us home. As soon as I came in the door of my house
Tatra said “I can’t believe you two would go in the woods! For
breaking my rules you both are grounded for one month!” I said “But Mom! I- I- I didn’t do it! It was Margy! Please! BELIEVE
ME!!!!” Tatra said “I have heard enough YOU ARE
GROUNDED!!!!” As I went into my room, I planned to prove my
innocence. So I came up with a plan. One month later when I got
ungrounded, We went to the park again but this time i got my
phone. So Margy went into the woods and she started bragging
about how she wasn’t going to be in trouble and that I was. The
whole time she said that, I was recording her. So after she
stopped bragging she said “What are you doing?” I said “Um...
Nothing?” I ran to Tatra and explained to her what happened, and
I showed Margy’s mom the video. Margy ran up to my mom and
said “Mrs. Tatra! It wasn’t me! I was framed!”
Her mom came up to her and said “It wasn’t you? Then why does
that video show proof? Are you lying?” Margy said “No! I was
framed!” Margy’s mom said “YOU FRAMED AARON!!! When we
get home you are in a lot of trouble Missy...”
Margy’s mom dragged Margy home.
Margy got grounded. My mom said “I’m sorry for blaming you...
you are a good kid and you’d never do this.” I said “It’s ok mom. I
understand. Margy’s mom called Tatra and apologized. Margy
got disciplined. Margy never went into those woods again.
